codewords of the higher rate codes are prefixes of those of the lower rate
ones. A perfect family of such codes is one in which each of the codes in the
family is capacity-achieving. We show by construction that perfect rateless
codes with low-complexity decoding algorithms exist for additive white Gaussian
noise channels. Our construction involves the use of layered encoding and
successive decoding, together with repetition using time-varying layer weights.
As an illustration of our framework, we design a practical three-rate code
family. We further construct rich sets of near-perfect rateless codes within
our architecture that require either significantly fewer layers or lower
complexity than their perfect counterparts. Variations of the basic
construction are also developed, including one for time-varying channels in
which there is no a priori stochastic model.

of the problems closely connected to cryptography. For given two functions, f
and g, as an oracle which have domains of size N and M (N&lt;=M), respectively,
and the same range, the goal of the problem is to find x and y such that
f(x)=g(y). This paper describes an optimal algorithm using quantum walk that
solves this problem. Our algorithm can be generalized to find a claw of k
functions for any constant integer k&gt;1, where the domains of the functions may
have different size.

studied by T. Asano, J. Matousek and T. Tokuyama. It can be interpreted as a
state of equilibrium between several mutually hostile kingdoms. Formally, it is
a fixed point of a certain mapping. These authors considered the Euclidean
plane and proved the existence and uniqueness of zone diagrams there. In the
present paper we generalize this concept in various ways. We consider general
sites in m-spaces (a simple generalization of metric spaces) and prove several
existence and (non)uniqueness results in this setting. In contrast to previous
works, our (rather simple) proofs are based on purely order theoretic
arguments. Many explicit examples are given, and some of them illustrate new
phenomena which occur in the general case. We also re-interpret zone diagrams
as a stable configuration in a certain combinatorial game, and provide an
algorithm for finding this configuration in a particular case.

set is studied, where two users (users 1 and 2) attempt to transmit common
information to a destination, and user 1 also has confidential information
intended for the destination. Moreover, user 1 wishes to keep its confidential
information as secret as possible from user 2. A deterministic GMAC is first
studied, and the capacity-equivocation region and the secrecy capacity region
are obtained. Two main classes of the GMAC are then studied: the binary GMAC
and the Gaussian GMAC. For both channels, the capacity-equivocation region and
the secrecy capacity region are established.

channel and the source-to-wire-tapper channel are corrupted by multiplicative
fading gain coefficients in addition to additive Gaussian noise terms. The
channel state information is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and
the receiver. The parallel wire-tap channel with independent subchannels is
first studied, which serves as an information-theoretic model for the fading
wire-tap channel. The secrecy capacity of the parallel wire-tap channel is
established. This result is then specialized to give the secrecy capacity of
the fading wire-tap channel, which is achieved with the source node dynamically
changing the power allocation according to the channel state realization. An
optimal source power allocation is obtained to achieve the secrecy capacity.

various communication media generated new problems at various levels including
the rate of flow of information, problems of storage and management. The
difficulty which arises is no longer the existence of information but rather
the access to this information. When designing multimedia information retrieval
system, it is appropriate to bear in mind the potential users and their
information needs. We assumed that multimedia information representation which
takes into account explicitly the users' needs and the cases of use could
contribute to the adaptation potentials of the system for the end-users. We
believe also that responses of multimedia information system would be more
relevant to the users' needs if the types of results to be used from the system
were identified before the design and development of the system. We propose the
integration of the users' information needs. More precisely integrating usage
contexts of resulting information in an information system (during creation and
feedback) should enhance more pertinent users' need. The first section of this
study is dedicated to traditional multimedia information systems and
specifically the approaches of representing multimedia information. Taking into
account the dynamism of users, these approaches do not permit the explicit
integration of the users' information needs. In this paper, we will present our
proposals based on economic intelligence approach. This approach emphasizes the
importance of starting any process of information retrieval witch the user
information need.

wants to locate a sync pattern at the output of a channel on the basis of
sequential observations. We assume that the sync pattern of length N starts
being emitted at a random time within some interval of size A, that
characterizes the asynchronism level between the transmitter and the receiver.
We show that a sequential decoder can optimally locate the sync pattern, i.e.,
exactly, without delay, and with probability approaching one as N tends to
infinity, if and only if the asynchronism level grows as O(exp(N*k)), with k
below the `synchronization threshold,' a constant that admits a simple
expression depending on the channel. This constant is the same as the one that
characterizes the limit for reliable asynchronous communication, as was
recently reported by the authors. If k exceeds the synchronization threshold,
any decoder, sequential or non-sequential, locates the sync pattern with an
error that tends to one as N tends to infinity. Hence, a sequential decoder can
locate a sync pattern as well as the (non-sequential) maximum likelihood
decoder that operates on the basis of output sequences of maximum length A+N-1,
but with much fewer observations.

Among ordered types of
trees there are many variants whose basic operations such as insert, delete,
search, delete-min are characterized by logarithmic time complexity. In the
article I am going to present the structure whose time complexity for each of
the above operations is $O(\frac{M}{K} + K)$, where M is the size of data type
and K is constant properly matching the size of data type. Properly matched K
will make the structure function as a very effective Priority Queue. The
structure size linearly depends on the number and size of elements. PTrie is a
clever combination of the idea of prefix tree -- Trie, structure of logarithmic
time complexity for insert and remove operations, doubly linked list and
queues.

data by Uludag and Jain. We show that this instance of the vault is vulnerable
to brute force attack. An interceptor of the vault data can recover both secret
and template data using only generally affordable computational resources. Some
possible alternatives are then discussed and it is suggested that cryptographic
security may be preferable to the one - way function approach to biometric
security.

pairing-based cryptography. Recently with the introduction of the Duursma-Lee
method special attention has been given to the fields of characteristic 3.
Especially multiplication in F_{3^{6m}}, where m is prime, is an important
operation in the above method. In this paper we propose a new method to reduce
the number of F_{3^m} multiplications for multiplication in F_{3^{6m}} from 18
in recent implementations to 15. The method is based on the fast Fourier
tranmsform and explicit formulas are given. The execution times of our software
implementations for F_{3^{6m}} show the efficiency of our results.

  Cooperative Networks</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Space-time block codes (STBCs) that are single-symbol decodable (SSD) in a
co-located multiple antenna setting need not be SSD in a distributed
cooperative communication setting. A relay network with N relays and a single
source-destination pair is called a partially-coherent relay channel (PCRC) if
the destination has perfect channel state information (CSI) of all the channels
and the relays have only the phase information of the source-to-relay channels.
In this paper, first, a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a
STBC to be SSD for co-located multiple antenna communication is obtained. Then,
this is extended to a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a
distributed STBC (DSTBC) to be SSD for a PCRC, by identifying the additional
conditions. Using this, several SSD DSTBCs for PCRC are identified among the
known classes of STBCs. It is proved that even if a SSD STBC for a co-located
MIMO channel does not satisfy the additional conditions for the code to be SSD
for a PCRC, single-symbol decoding of it in a PCRC gives full-diversity and
only coding gain is lost. It is shown that when a DSTBC is SSD for a PCRC, then
arbitrary coordinate interleaving of the in-phase and quadrature-phase
components of the variables does not disturb its SSD property for PCRC.
Finally, it is shown that the possibility of {\em channel phase compensation}
operation at the relay nodes using partial CSI at the relays increases the
possible rate of SSD DSTBCs from $\frac{2}{N}$ when the relays do not have CSI
to 1/2, which is independent of N.

for F_{3^97}. We also propose new formulas for multiplication in F_{3^{6*97}}.
These new formulas reduce the number of F_{3^97}-multiplications from 18 to 15.
The fields F_{3^{97}} and F_{3^{6*97}} are relevant in the context of
pairing-based cryptography.

  Conference (GLOBECOM), Washington, DC, November 26 - 30, 2007</comments><abstract>  Mobile ad hoc networks are expected to support voice traffic. The requirement
for small delay and jitter of voice traffic poses a significant challenge for
medium access control (MAC) in such networks. User mobility makes it more
complex due to the associated dynamic path attenuation. In this paper, a MAC
scheme for mobile ad hoc networks supporting voice traffic is proposed. With
the aid of a low-power probe prior to DATA transmissions, resource reservation
is achieved in a distributed manner, thus leading to small delay and jitter.
The proposed scheme can automatically adapt to dynamic path attenuation in a
mobile environment. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme.

  Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Model</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><abstract>  In this paper, we study network coding capacity for random wireless networks.
Previous work on network coding capacity for wired and wireless networks have
focused on the case where the capacities of links in the network are
independent. In this paper, we consider a more realistic model, where wireless
networks are modeled by random geometric graphs with interference and noise. In
this model, the capacities of links are not independent. We consider two
scenarios, single source multiple destinations and multiple sources multiple
destinations. In the first scenario, employing coupling and martingale methods,
we show that the network coding capacity for random wireless networks still
exhibits a concentration behavior around the mean value of the minimum cut
under some mild conditions. Furthermore, we establish upper and lower bounds on
the network coding capacity for dependent and independent nodes. In the second
one, we also show that the network coding capacity still follows a
concentration behavior. Our simulation results confirm our theoretical
predictions.

  Fedora-Core Linux 5.0</title><categories>cs.NI</categories><abstract>  As the web grows and the amount of traffics on the web server increase,
problems related to performance begin to appear. Some of the problems, such as
the number of users that can access the server simultaneously, the number of
requests that can be handled by the server per second (requests per second) to
bandwidth consumption and hardware utilization like memories and CPU. To give
better quality of service (\textbf{\textit{QoS}}), web hosting providers and
also the system administrators and network administrators who manage the server
need a benchmark application to measure the capabilities of their servers.
Later, the application intends to work under Linux/Unix -- like platforms and
built using Erlang/OTP R11 as a concurrent oriented language under Fedora Core
Linux 5.0. \textbf{\textit{WiiBench}} is divided into two main parts, the
controller section and the launcher section. Controller is the core of the
application. It has several duties, such as read the benchmark scenario file,
configure the program based on the scenario, initialize the launcher section,
gather the benchmark results from local and remote Erlang node where the
launcher runs and write them in a log file (later the log file will be used to
generate a report page for the sysadmin). Controller also has function as a
timer which act as timing for user inters arrival to the server. Launcher
generates a number of users based on the scenario, initialize them and start
the benchmark by sending requests to the web server. The clients also gather
the benchmark result and send them to the controller.

we consider generalizations of the Frobenius problem to the noncommutative

assignment of values to a set of variables subject to specified constraints. In
the minimum cost homomorphism problem ($MinHom$), one is additionally given
weights $c_{va}$ for every variable $v$ and value $a$, and the aim is to find
an assignment $f$ to the variables that minimizes $\sum_{v} c_{vf(v)}$. Let
$MinHom(\Gamma)$ denote the $MinHom$ problem parameterized by the set of
predicates allowed for constraints. $MinHom(\Gamma)$ is related to many
well-studied combinatorial optimization problems, and concrete applications can
be found in, for instance, defence logistics and machine learning. We show that
$MinHom(\Gamma)$ can be studied by using algebraic methods similar to those
used for CSPs. With the aid of algebraic techniques, we classify the
computational complexity of $MinHom(\Gamma)$ for all choices of $\Gamma$. Our
result settles a general dichotomy conjecture previously resolved only for
certain classes of directed graphs, [Gutin, Hell, Rafiey, Yeo, European J. of
Combinatorics, 2008].

expressions involving unions and intersections of sets can be computed in a
worst-case efficient way. This problem has applications in e.g. information
retrieval and database systems. We mainly consider the RAM model of
computation, and sets of machine words, but also state our results in the I/O
model. On a RAM with word size $w$, a special case of our result is that the
intersection of $m$ (preprocessed) sets, containing $n$ elements in total, can
be computed in expected time $O(n (\log w)^2 / w + km)$, where $k$ is the
number of elements in the intersection. If the first of the two terms
dominates, this is a factor $w^{1-o(1)}$ faster than the standard solution of
merging sorted lists. We show a cell probe lower bound of time $\Omega(n/(w m
\log m)+ (1-\tfrac{\log k}{w}) k)$, meaning that our upper bound is nearly
optimal for small $m$. Our algorithm uses a novel combination of approximate
set representations and word-level parallelism.

is conducted on the basis of a prescribed Cartesian workspace with prescribed
kinetostatic performances. The resulting machine, the Orthoglide, features
three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile
platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The
interesting features of the Orthoglide are a regular Cartesian workspace shape,
uniform performances in all directions and good compactness. A small-scale
prototype of the Orthoglide under development is presented at the end of this

  Data-Rate of the Single-Symbol ML Decodable Distributed STBCs</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><abstract>  Very recently, we proposed the row-monomial distributed orthogonal space-time
block codes (DOSTBCs) and showed that the row-monomial DOSTBCs achieved
approximately twice higher bandwidth efficiency than the repetitionbased
cooperative strategy [1]. However, we imposed two limitations on the
row-monomial DOSTBCs. The first one was that the associated matrices of the
codes must be row-monomial. The other was the assumption that the relays did
not have any channel state information (CSI) of the channels from the source to
the relays, although this CSI could be readily obtained at the relays without
any additional pilot signals or any feedback overhead. In this paper, we first
remove the row-monomial limitation; but keep the CSI limitation. In this case,
we derive an upper bound of the data-rate of the DOSTBC and it is larger than
that of the row-monomial DOSTBCs in [1]. Secondly, we abandon the CSI
limitation; but keep the row-monomial limitation. Specifically, we propose the
row-monomial DOSTBCs with channel phase information (DOSTBCs-CPI) and derive an
upper bound of the data-rate of those codes. The rowmonomial DOSTBCs-CPI have
higher data-rate than the DOSTBCs and the row-monomial DOSTBCs. Furthermore, we
find the actual row-monomial DOSTBCs-CPI which achieve the upper bound of the
data-rate.

graph algorithms; Finding the Shortest Path with Positive Weights and Minimum
Spanning Tree. I will show so far known solution set of basic graph problems
and present my own. My solutions to graph problems are characterized by their
linear worst-case time complexity. It should be noticed that the algorithms
which compute the Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree problems not only
analyze the weight of arcs (which is the main and often the only criterion of
solution hitherto known algorithms) but also in case of identical path weights
they select this path which walks through as few vertices as possible. I have
presented algorithms which use priority queue based on multilevel prefix tree
-- PTrie. PTrie is a clever combination of the idea of prefix tree -- Trie, the
structure of logarithmic time complexity for insert and remove operations,
doubly linked list and queues. In C++ I will implement linear worst-case time
algorithm computing the Single-Destination Shortest-Paths problem and I will
explain its usage.

multi block approach enables a cluster to be divided into several independent
blocks which run jobs owned by different users simultaneously. Previously, we
have maintained the blocks using single master node for all blocks due to
efficiency and resource limitations. Following recent advancements and
expansion of node\'s number, we have modified the multi block approach with
multiple master nodes, each of them is responsible for a single block. We argue
that this approach improves the overall performance significantly, for
especially data intensive computational works.

a finite state automaton or equivalently by an MLO formula. We investigate a

new class of phylogenetic networks, called tree-child phylogenetic networks,
where every non-extant species has some descendant through mutation. We provide
an injective representation of these networks as multisets of vectors of
natural numbers, their path multiplicity vectors, and we use this
representation to define a distance on this class and to give an alignment
method for pairs of these networks. To the best of our knowledge, they are
respectively the first true distance and the first alignment method defined on
a meaningful class of phylogenetic networks strictly extending the class of
phylogenetic trees. Simple, polynomial algorithms for reconstructing a
tree-child phylogenetic network from its path multiplicity vectors, for
computing the distance between two tree-child phylogenetic networks, and for
aligning a pair of tree-child phylogenetic networks, are provided, and they
have been implemented as a Perl package and a Java applet, and they are

  Scalability</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><abstract>  We present a joint source-channel multiple description (JSC-MD) framework for
resource-constrained network communications (e.g., sensor networks), in which
one or many deprived encoders communicate a Markov source against bit errors
and erasure errors to many heterogeneous decoders, some powerful and some
deprived. To keep the encoder complexity at minimum, the source is coded into K
descriptions by a simple multiple description quantizer (MDQ) with neither
entropy nor channel coding. The code diversity of MDQ and the path diversity of
the network are exploited by decoders to correct transmission errors and
improve coding efficiency. A key design objective is resource scalability:
powerful nodes in the network can perform JSC-MD distributed
estimation/decoding under the criteria of maximum a posteriori probability
(MAP) or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), while primitive nodes resort to
simpler MD decoding, all working with the same MDQ code. The application of
JSC-MD to distributed estimation of hidden Markov models in a sensor network is
demonstrated. The proposed JSC-MD MAP estimator is an algorithm of the longest
path in a weighted directed acyclic graph, while the JSC-MD MMSE decoder is an
extension of the well-known forward-backward algorithm to multiple
descriptions. Both algorithms simultaneously exploit the source memory, the
redundancy of the fixed-rate MDQ, and the inter-description correlations. They
outperform the existing hard-decision MDQ decoders by large margins (up to
8dB). For Gaussian Markov sources, the complexity of JSC-MD distributed MAP
sequence estimation can be made as low as that of typical single description
Viterbi-type algorithms.

security protocols. In this paper, we revisit and extend the NP-complete
decision procedure for a bounded number of sessions. We use a, now standard,
deducibility constraints formalism for modeling security protocols. Our first
contribution is to give a simple set of constraint simplification rules, that
allows to reduce any deducibility constraint system to a set of solved forms,
representing all solutions (within the bound on sessions).
  As a consequence, we prove that deciding the existence of key cycles is
NP-complete for a bounded number of sessions. The problem of key-cycles has
been put forward by recent works relating computational and symbolic models.
The so-called soundness of the symbolic model requires indeed that no key cycle
(e.g., enc(k,k)) ever occurs in the execution of the protocol. Otherwise,
stronger security assumptions (such as KDM-security) are required.
  We show that our decision procedure can also be applied to prove again the
decidability of authentication-like properties and the decidability of a
significant fragment of protocols with timestamps.

  Multi-Hop Channels</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>submitted to Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and
  Networking</comments><abstract>  Consider a wireless MIMO multi-hop channel with n_s non-cooperating source
antennas and n_d fully cooperating destination antennas, as well as L clusters
containing k non-cooperating relay antennas each. The source signal traverses
all L clusters of relay antennas, before it reaches the destination. When relay
antennas within the same cluster scale their received signals by the same
constant before the retransmission, the equivalent channel matrix H relating
the input signals at the source antennas to the output signals at the
destination antennas is proportional to the product of channel matrices H_l,
l=1,...,L+1, corresponding to the individual hops. We perform an asymptotic
capacity analysis for this channel as follows: In a first instance we take the
limits n_s-&gt;infty, n_d-&gt;infty and k-&gt;infty, but keep both n_s/n_d and k/n_d
fixed. Then, we take the limits L-&gt;infty and k/n_d-&gt;infty. Requiring that the
H_l's satisfy the conditions needed for the Marcenko-Pastur law, we prove that
the capacity scales linearly in min{n_s,n_d}, as long as the ratio k/n_d scales
at least linearly in L. Moreover, we show that up to a noise penalty and a
pre-log factor the capacity of a point-to-point MIMO channel is approached,
when this scaling is slightly faster than linear. Conversely, almost all
spatial degrees of freedom vanish for less than linear scaling.

characteristic 3 is presented in this article. The principal objects utilized
for that purpose are the Cauchy and Vandermonde matrices, the discriminant
function and their generalizations of various types. Classical theorems on the
permanent such as the Binet-Minc identity and Borchadt's formula are widely
applied, while a special new technique involving the notion of limit re-defined
for fields of finite characteristics and corresponding computational methods
was developed in order to deal with a number of polynomial-time reductions. All
the constructions preserve a strictly algebraic nature ignoring the structure
of the basic field, while applying its infinite extensions for calculating
limits.
  A natural corollary of the polynomial-time computability of the permanent in
a field of a characteristic different from 2 is the non-uniform equality
between the complexity classes P and NP what is equivalent to RP=NP (Ref. [1]).

  Estimation Inaccuracies</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications, July 2007</comments><abstract>  The optimal decoder achieving the outage capacity under imperfect channel
estimation is investigated. First, by searching into the family of nearest
neighbor decoders, which can be easily implemented on most practical coded
modulation systems, we derive a decoding metric that minimizes the average of
the transmission error probability over all channel estimation errors. Next, we
specialize our general expression to obtain the corresponding decoding metric
for fading MIMO channels. According to the notion of estimation-induced outage
(EIO) capacity introduced in our previous work and assuming no channel state
information (CSI) at the transmitter, we characterize maximal achievable
information rates, using Gaussian codebooks, associated to the proposed
decoder. In the case of uncorrelated Rayleigh fading, these achievable rates
are compared to the rates achieved by the classical mismatched
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder and the ultimate limits given by the EIO
capacity. Numerical results show that the derived metric provides significant
gains for the considered scenario, in terms of achievable information rates and
bit error rate (BER), in a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) framework,
without introducing any additional decoding complexity.

advances in the multimodal usability area, in-as-much as it addresses one of
the major issues relating to the generation of effective oral system messages:
how to design messages which effectively help users to locate specific
graphical objects in information visualisations? An experimental study was
carried out to determine whether oral messages including coarse information on
the locations of graphical objects on the current display may facilitate target
detection tasks sufficiently for making it worth while to integrate such
messages in GUIs. The display spatial layout varied in order to test the
influence of visual presentation structure on the contribution of these
messages to facilitating visual search on crowded displays. Finally, three
levels of task difficulty were defined, based mainly on the target visual
complexity and the number of distractors in the scene. The findings suggest
that spatial information messages improve participants' visual search
performances significantly; they are more appropriate to radial structures than
to matrix, random and elleptic structures; and, they are particularly useful
for performing difficult visual search tasks.

  Interaction, Las Vegas : \'Etats-Unis d'Am\'erique (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The paper tries to point out the benefits that can be derived from research
advances in the implementation of concepts such as ambient intelligence (AmI)
and ubiquitous or pervasive computing for promoting Universal Access (UA) to
the Information Society, that is, for contributing to enable everybody,
especially Physically Disabled (PD) people, to have easy access to all
computing resources and information services that the coming worldwide
Information Society will soon make available to the general public. Following
definitions of basic concepts relating to multimodal interaction, the
significant contribution of multimodality to developing UA is briefly argued.
Then, a short state of the art in AmI research is presented. In the last
section we bring out the potential contribution of advances in AmI research and
technology to the improvement of computer access for PD people. This claim is
supported by the following observations: (i) most projects aiming at
implementing AmI focus on the design of new interaction modalities and flexible
multimodal user interfaces which may facilitate PD users' computer access ;
(ii) targeted applications will support users in a wide range of daily
activities which will be performed simultaneously with supporting computing
tasks; therefore, users will be placed in contexts where they will be
confronted with similar difficulties to those encountered by PD users; (iii)
AmI applications being intended for the general public, a wide range of new
interaction devices and flexible processing software will be available, making
it possible to provide PD users with human-computer facilities tailored to
their specific needs at reasonable expense..

approximating the matrix using a small number of ``components.'' Typically,
these components are linear combinations of the rows and columns of the matrix,
and are thus difficult to interpret in terms of the original features of the
input data. In this paper, we propose and study matrix approximations that are
explicitly expressed in terms of a small number of columns and/or rows of the
data matrix, and thereby more amenable to interpretation in terms of the
original data. Our main algorithmic results are two randomized algorithms which
take as input an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ and a rank parameter $k$. In our first
algorithm, $C$ is chosen, and we let $A'=CC^+A$, where $C^+$ is the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of $C$. In our second algorithm $C$, $U$, $R$
are chosen, and we let $A'=CUR$. ($C$ and $R$ are matrices that consist of
actual columns and rows, respectively, of $A$, and $U$ is a generalized inverse
of their intersection.) For each algorithm, we show that with probability at
least $1-\delta$: $$ ||A-A'||_F \leq (1+\epsilon) ||A-A_k||_F, $$ where $A_k$
is the ``best'' rank-$k$ approximation provided by truncating the singular
value decomposition (SVD) of $A$. The number of columns of $C$ and rows of $R$
is a low-degree polynomial in $k$, $1/\epsilon$, and $\log(1/\delta)$. Our two
algorithms are the first polynomial time algorithms for such low-rank matrix
approximations that come with relative-error guarantees; previously, in some
cases, it was not even known whether such matrix decompositions exist. Both of
our algorithms are simple, they take time of the order needed to approximately
compute the top $k$ singular vectors of $A$, and they use a novel, intuitive
sampling method called ``subspace sampling.''

convolutional coding structure. We provide a method for converting an arbitrary
classical binary or quaternary convolutional code into a convolutional
entanglement distillation protocol. The imported classical convolutional code
does not have to be dual-containing or self-orthogonal. The yield and
error-correcting properties of such a protocol depend respectively on the rate
and error-correcting properties of the imported classical convolutional code. A
convolutional entanglement distillation protocol has several other benefits.
Two parties sharing noisy ebits can distill noiseless ebits ``online'' as they
acquire more noisy ebits. Distillation yield is high and decoding complexity is
simple for a convolutional entanglement distillation protocol. Our theory of
convolutional entanglement distillation reduces the problem of finding a good
convolutional entanglement distillation protocol to the well-established
problem of finding a good classical convolutional code.

handle in mechanical proofs. In this paper, we show how these calculations can
be performed within a theorem prover or proof assistant in a convenient and
highly automated as well as interactive way. First, we formally establish upper
and lower bounds for elementary functions. Then, based on these bounds, we
develop a rational interval arithmetic where real number calculations take
place in an algebraic setting. In order to reduce the dependency effect of
interval arithmetic, we integrate two techniques: interval splitting and taylor
series expansions. This pragmatic approach has been developed, and formally
verified, in a theorem prover. The formal development also includes a set of
customizable strategies to automate proofs involving explicit calculations over
real numbers. Our ultimate goal is to provide guaranteed proofs of numerical
properties with minimal human theorem-prover interaction.

large arguments but as the input grows there are no bit left to approximate the
constant with enough accuracy. Under mild assumptions, we show that the result
computed with a fused-multiply-add provides a fully accurate result for many
possible values of the input with a constant almost accurate to the full
working precision. We also present an algorithm for a fully accurate second
reduction step to reach double full accuracy (all the significand bits of two
numbers are significant) even in the worst cases of argument reduction. Our
work recalls the common algorithms and presents proofs of correctness. All the
proofs are formally verified using the Coq automatic proof checker.

Other machining operations can be modeled. This parametric stiffness analysis
can be applied to any parallel manipulator for which stiffness is a critical

without leaving any trace of such event. The problem of locating the black hole
in a network through a team of agent coordinated by a common protocol is
usually referred in literature as the Black Hole Search problem (or BHS for
brevity) and it is a consolidated research topic in the area of distributed
algorithms. The aim of this paper is to extend the results for BHS by
considering more general (and hence harder) classes of dangerous host. In
particular we introduce rB-hole as a probabilistic generalization of the Black
Hole, in which the destruction of an incoming agent is a purely random event
happening with some fixed probability (like flipping a biased coin). The main
result we present is that if we tolerate an arbitrarily small error probability
in the result then the rB-hole Search problem, or RBS, is not harder than the
usual BHS. We establish this result in two different communication model,
specifically both in presence or absence of whiteboards non-located at the
homebase. The core of our methods is a general reduction tool for transforming
algorithms for the black hole into algorithms for the rB-hole.

role of dynamic adaptation. Then, a few representative research studies are

major issues regarding the utility and usability of adaptive user interfaces

asymptotic distribution of that statistical behavior is derived from
geometrical arguments. This distribution is related with the Gamma
distributions found in several multi-agent economy models. The parallelism with
all these systems is established. Also, as a collateral result, a formula for
the volume of high-dimensional symmetrical bodies is proposed.

  Mechanisms</title><categories>cs.RO</categories><proxy>ccsd hal-00168494</proxy><journal-ref>Journal of Mechanism and Machine Theory 40, 8 (2005) 907-930</journal-ref><abstract>  The paper addresses the geometric synthesis of Orthoglide-type mechanism, a
family of 3-DOF parallel manipulators for rapid machining applications, which
combine advantages of both serial mechanisms and parallel kinematic
architectures. These manipulators possess quasi-isotropic kinematic
performances and are made up of three actuated fixed prismatic joints, which
are mutually orthogonal and connected to a mobile platform via three
parallelogram chains. The platform moves in the Cartesian space with fixed
orientation, similar to conventional XYZ-machine. Three strategies have been
proposed to define the Orthoglide geometric parameters (manipulator link
lengths and actuated joint limits) as functions of a cubic workspace size and
dextrous properties expressed by bounds on the velocity transmission factors,
manipulability or the Jacobian condition number. Low inertia and intrinsic
stiffness have been set as additional design goals expressed by the minimal
link length requirement. For each design strategy, analytical expressions for
computing the Orthoglide parameters are proposed. It is showed that the
proposed strategies yield Pareto-optimal solutions, which differ by the
kinematic performances outside the prescribed Cartesian cube (but within the
workspace bounded by the actuated joint limits). The proposed technique is
illustrated with numerical examples for the Orthoglide prototype design.

manipulators that have at least one of their DH parameters equal to zero. This
classification is based on the topology of their workspace. The workspace is
characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves. The workspace
topology is defined by the number of cusps and nodes that appear on these
singular curves. The manipulators are classified into different types with
similar kinematic properties. Each type is evaluated according to interesting
kinematic properties such as, whether the workspace is fully reachable with
four inverse kinematic solutions or not, the existence of voids, and the
feasibility of continuous trajectories in the workspace. It is found that
several orthogonal manipulators have a &quot;well-connected&quot; workspace, that is,
their workspace is fully accessible with four inverse kinematic solutions and
any continuous trajectory is feasible. This result is of interest for the
design of alternative manipulator geometries.

Internet, is a simple undirected unweighted graph. This approximation, however,
loses too much detail. In reality, objects represented by vertices and edges in
such a graph possess some non-trivial internal structure that varies across and
differentiates among distinct types of links or nodes. In this work, we
abstract such additional information as network annotations. We introduce a
network topology modeling framework that treats annotations as an extended
correlation profile of a network. Assuming we have this profile measured for a
given network, we present an algorithm to rescale it in order to construct
networks of varying size that still reproduce the original measured annotation
profile.
  Using this methodology, we accurately capture the network properties
essential for realistic simulations of network applications and protocols, or
any other simulations involving complex network topologies, including modeling
and simulation of network evolution. We apply our approach to the Autonomous
System (AS) topology of the Internet annotated with business relationships
between ASs. This topology captures the large-scale structure of the Internet.
In depth understanding of this structure and tools to model it are cornerstones
of research on future Internet architectures and designs. We find that our
techniques are able to accurately capture the structure of annotation
correlations within this topology, thus reproducing a number of its important
properties in synthetically-generated random graphs.

single-layer feed-forward networks is developed for situations where a given
data set is composed of correlated patterns. The framework is based on the
assumption that the left and right singular value bases of the given pattern
matrix are generated independently and uniformly from Haar measures. This
assumption makes it possible to characterize the objective system by a single
function of two variables which is determined by the eigenvalue spectrum of the
cross-correlation matrix of the pattern matrix. Links to existing methods for
analysis of perceptron learning and Gaussian linear vector channels and an
application to a simple but nontrivial problem are also shown.

  d'Am\'erique (2006)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper deals with the in-depth kinematic analysis of a special spherical
parallel wrist, called the Agile Eye. The Agile Eye is a three-legged spherical
parallel robot with revolute joints in which all pairs of adjacent joint axes
are orthogonal. Its most peculiar feature, demonstrated in this paper for the
first time, is that its (orientation) workspace is unlimited and flawed only by
six singularity curves (rather than surfaces). Furthermore, these curves
correspond to self-motions of the mobile platform. This paper also demonstrates
that, unlike for any other such complex spatial robots, the four solutions to
the direct kinematics of the Agile Eye (assembly modes) have a simple geometric
relationship with the eight solutions to the inverse kinematics (working
modes).

twenty years ago. This observation still holds nowadays, although online help
to the use of software for the general public has greatly improved in usability
during this period. The paper first demonstrates the necessity of online help
to the use of new software whatever the transparency of the user interface, as
whether online help systems are meant to compensate for interface design
weaknesses or actually do provide necessary assistance to the discovery of a
new software package functionalities is still an unsolved issue. The discussion
relies on results of empirical and experimental studies and theoretical
arguments. In the second part, we analyse the specific difficulties raised by
the design of effective online help systems for current software intended for
the general public so as to try and understand the reluctance of novice users
to use online help. In the last part, we present and discuss the possible
contributions of various approaches to solving this issue. Recent interaction
paradigms and techniques are considered, such as, static and dynamic
personalisation, contextual online help and new forms of multimodality.

  271-286</journal-ref><abstract>  The question how social norms can emerge from microscopic interactions
between individuals is a key problem in social sciences to explain collective
behavior. In this paper we propose an agent-based model to show that randomly
distributed social behavior by way of local interaction converges to a state
with a multimodal distribution of behavior. This can be interpreted as a
coexistence of different social norms, a result that goes beyond previous
investigations. The model is discrete in time and space, behavior is
characterized in a continuous state space. The adaptation of social behavior by
each agent is based on attractive and repulsive forces caused by friendly and
adversary relations among agents. The model is analyzed both analytically and
by means of spatio-temporal computer simulations. It provides conditions under
which we find convergence towards a single norm, coexistence of two opposing
norms, and coexistence of a multitude of norms. For the latter case, we also
show the evolution of the spatio-temporal distribution of behavior.

code of length n and minimum distance d satisfies A_2(n,d) &gt;= 2^n/V(n,d-1)
where V(n,d) stands for the volume of a Hamming ball of radius d. Recently
Jiang and Vardy showed that for binary non-linear codes this bound can be
improved to A_2(n,d) &gt;= cn2^n/V(n,d-1) for c a constant and d/n &lt;= 0.499. In
this paper we show that certain asymptotic families of linear binary [n,n/2]
random double circulant codes satisfy the same improved Gilbert-Varshamov
bound.

the polynomial hierarchy or for PSPACE. The rationale of this technique is that
some problem restrictions are able to simulate existential or universal
quantifiers. If this is the case, reductions from Quantified Boolean Formulae
(QBF) to these restrictions can be transformed into reductions from QBFs having
one more quantifier in the front. This means that a proof of hardness of a
problem at level n in the polynomial hierarchy can be split into n separate
proofs, which may be simpler than a proof directly showing a reduction from a
class of QBFs to the considered problem.

Sigma^0_alpha-complete omega-powers, and some Pi^0_alpha-complete omega-powers,
extending previous works on the topological complexity of omega-powers. We
prove effective versions of these results. In particular, for each non null
recursive ordinal alpha, there exists a recursive finitary language A such that
A^omega is Sigma^0_alpha-complete (respectively, Pi^0_alpha-complete). To do
this, we prove effective versions of a result by Kuratowski, describing a Borel
set as the range of a closed subset of the Baire space by a continuous
bijection. This leads us to prove closure properties for the classes
Effective-Pi^0_alpha and Effective-Sigma^0_alpha of the hyperarithmetical
hierarchy in arbitrary recursively presented Polish spaces. We apply our
existence results to get better computations of the topological complexity of
some sets of dictionaries considered by the second author in [Omega-Powers and
Descriptive Set Theory, Journal of Symbolic Logic, Volume 70 (4), 2005, p.
1210-1232].

  Mathematical Engineering</comments><report-no>TR-PME-2007-08</report-no><abstract>  Distributed Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes (DOSTBCs) achieving full
diversity order and single-symbol ML decodability have been introduced recently
for cooperative networks and an upper-bound on the maximal rate of such codes
along with code constructions has been presented. In this report, we introduce
a new class of Distributed STBCs called Semi-orthogonal Precoded Distributed
Single-Symbol Decodable STBCs (S-PDSSDC) wherein, the source performs
co-ordinate interleaving of information symbols appropriately before
transmitting it to all the relays. It is shown that DOSTBCs are a special case
of S-PDSSDCs. A special class of S-PDSSDCs having diagonal covariance matrix at
the destination is studied and an upper bound on the maximal rate of such codes
is derived. The bounds obtained are approximately twice larger than that of the
DOSTBCs. A systematic construction of S-PDSSDCs is presented when the number of
relays $K \geq 4$. The constructed codes are shown to achieve the upper-bound
on the rate when $K$ is of the form 0 modulo 4 or 3 modulo 4. For the rest of
the values of $K$, the constructed codes are shown to have rates higher than
that of DOSTBCs. It is also shown that S-PDSSDCs cannot be constructed with any
form of linear processing at the relays when the source doesn't perform
co-ordinate interleaving of the information symbols.

the framework of Wyner's wiretap channel. We characterize the secrecy capacity
in terms of generalized eigenvalues when the sender and eavesdropper have
multiple antennas, the intended receiver has a single antenna, and the channel
matrices are fixed and known to all the terminals, and show that a beamforming
strategy is capacity-achieving. In addition, we show that in the high
signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regime the penalty for not knowing eavesdropper's
channel is small--a simple ``secure space-time code'' that can be thought of as
masked beamforming and radiates power isotropically attains near-optimal
performance. In the limit of large number of antennas, we obtain a
realization-independent characterization of the secrecy capacity as a function
of the number $\beta$: the number of eavesdropper antennas per sender antenna.
We show that the eavesdropper is comparatively ineffective when $\beta&lt;1$, but
that for $\beta\ge2$ the eavesdropper can drive the secrecy capacity to zero,
thereby blocking secure communication to the intended receiver. Extensions to
ergodic fading channels are also provided.

optimal per-edge processing times and therefore surpass all previous
semi-streaming algorithms for these tasks. The semi-streaming model, which is
appropriate when dealing with massive graphs, forbids random access to the
input and restricts the memory to O(n*polylog n) bits.
  Particularly, the formerly best per-edge processing times for finding the
connected components and a bipartition are O(alpha(n)), for determining
k-vertex and k-edge connectivity O(k^2n) and O(n*log n) respectively for any
constant k and for computing a minimum spanning forest O(log n). All these time
bounds we reduce to O(1).
  Every presented algorithm determines a solution asymptotically as fast as the
best corresponding algorithm up to date in the classical RAM model, which
therefore cannot convert the advantage of unlimited memory and random access
into superior computing times for these problems.

1931, he also introduced essential concepts of the theory of Artificial
Intelligence (AI). Although much of subsequent AI research has focused on
heuristics, which still play a major role in many practical AI applications, in
the new millennium AI theory has finally become a full-fledged formal science,
with important optimality results for embodied agents living in unknown
environments, obtained through a combination of theory a la Goedel and
probability theory. Here we look back at important milestones of AI history,
mention essential recent results, and speculate about what we may expect from
the next 25 years, emphasizing the significance of the ongoing dramatic
hardware speedups, and discussing Goedel-inspired, self-referential,
self-improving universal problem solvers.

translational Parallel Kinematic Machine. Two complementary methods are
developed to analyze its sensitivity to its dimensional and angular variations.
First, a linkage kinematic analysis method is used to have a rough idea of the
influence of the dimensional variations on the location of the end-effector.
Besides, this method shows that variations in the design parameters of the same
type from one leg to the other have the same influence on the end-effector.
However, this method does not take into account the variations in the
parallelograms. Thus, a differential vector method is used to study the
influence of the dimensional and angular variations in the parts of the
manipulator on the position and orientation of the end-effector, and
particularly the influence of the variations in the parallelograms. It turns
out that the kinematic isotropic configuration of the manipulator is the least
sensitive one to its dimensional and angular variations. On the contrary, the
closest configurations to its kinematic singular configurations are the most
sensitive ones to geometrical variations.

codes. Given a function $g\geq 0$ defined on all proper subsets of $N$ random
variables, we provide a construction for a network multicast problem which is
solvable if and only if $g$ is entropic. The underlying network topology is
fixed and the multicast problem depends on $g$ only through edge capacities and
source rates. Relaxing the requirement that the domain of $g$ be subsets of
random variables, we obtain a similar duality between polymatroids and the
linear programming bound. These duality results provide an alternative proof of
the insufficiency of linear (and abelian) network codes, and demonstrate the
utility of non-Shannon inequalities to tighten outer bounds on network coding
capacity regions.

$\alpha$ and $1-\alpha$ (denoted by $c_\alpha$ and $c_{1-\alpha}$
respectively), where $\alpha \in (0,1)$ is an irrational number such that
$\alpha = [0;1+d_1,\bar{d_2,...,d_n}]$ with $d_n \geq d_1 \geq 1$. It is known
that both $c_\alpha$ and $c_{1-\alpha}$ are fixed points of non-trivial
(standard) morphisms $\sigma$ and $\hat{\sigma}$, respectively, if and only if
$\alpha$ has a continued fraction expansion as above. Accordingly, such words
$c_\alpha$ and $c_{1-\alpha}$ are generated by the respective morphisms
$\sigma$ and $\hat{\sigma}$. For the particular case when $\alpha =
[0;2,\bar{r}]$ ($r\geq1$), we give a decomposition of each conjugate of
$c_\alpha$ (and hence $c_{1-\alpha}$) into generalized adjoining singular
words, by considering conjugates of powers of the standard morphism $\sigma$ by
which it is generated. This extends a recent result of Lev\'{e} and S\ee bold
on conjugates of the infinite Fibonacci word.

As $c_\alpha$ is a uniformly recurrent infinite word, any (palindromic) factor
of $c_\alpha$ occurs infinitely many times in $c_\alpha$ with bounded gaps. Our
aim is to completely describe where palindromes occur in $c_\alpha$. In
particular, given any palindromic factor $u$ of $c_\alpha$, we shall establish
a decomposition of $c_\alpha$ with respect to the occurrences of $u$. Such a
decomposition shows precisely where $u$ occurs in $c_\alpha$, and this is
directly related to the continued fraction expansion of $\alpha$.

discrete sine transform (DST-IV), as well as for the modified discrete cosine
transform (MDCT) and its inverse, that achieve a lower count of real
multiplications and additions than previously published algorithms, without
sacrificing numerical accuracy. Asymptotically, the operation count is reduced
from ~2NlogN to ~(17/9)NlogN for a power-of-two transform size N, and the exact
count is strictly lowered for all N &gt; 4. These results are derived by
considering the DCT to be a special case of a DFT of length 8N, with certain
symmetries, and then pruning redundant operations from a recent improved fast
Fourier transform algorithm (based on a recursive rescaling of the
conjugate-pair split radix algorithm). The improved algorithms for DST-IV and
MDCT follow immediately from the improved count for the DCT-IV.

studied powers in Sturmian words. The key tools in our analysis are canonical
decompositions and a generalization of singular words, which were originally
defined for the ubiquitous Fibonacci word. Our main results are demonstrated
via some examples, including the $k$-bonacci word: a generalization of the
Fibonacci word to a $k$-letter alphabet ($k\geq2$).

words min(w) and max(w) such that any prefix of min(w) (resp. max(w)) is the
lexicographically smallest (resp. greatest) amongst the factors of w of the
same length. We say that an infinite word w over A is &quot;fine&quot; if there exists an
infinite word u such that, for any lexicographic order, min(w) = au where a =
min(A). In this paper, we characterize fine words; specifically, we prove that
an infinite word w is fine if and only if w is either a &quot;strict episturmian
word&quot; or a strict &quot;skew episturmian word''. This characterization generalizes a
recent result of G. Pirillo, who proved that a fine word over a 2-letter
alphabet is either an (aperiodic) Sturmian word, or an ultimately periodic (but
not periodic) infinite word, all of whose factors are (finite) Sturmian.

  Complexity</title><categories>cs.IT cs.DM math.IT math.RA</categories><comments>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications. 10 pages,
  5 figures</comments><abstract>  The differential encoding/decoding setup introduced by Kiran et al,
Oggier-Hassibi and Jing-Jafarkhani for wireless relay networks that use
codebooks consisting of unitary matrices is extended to allow codebooks
consisting of scaled unitary matrices. For such codebooks to be usable in the
Jing-Hassibi protocol for cooperative diversity, the conditions involving the
relay matrices and the codebook that need to be satisfied are identified. Using
the algebraic framework of extended Clifford algebras, a new class of
Distributed Differential Space-Time Codes satisfying these conditions for power
of two number of relays and also achieving full cooperative diversity with a
low complexity sub-optimal receiver is proposed. Simulation results indicate
that the proposed codes outperform both the cyclic codes as well as the
circulant codes. Furthermore, these codes can also be applied as Differential
Space-Time codes for non-coherent communication in classical point to point
multiple antenna systems.

Consequently, we obtain a characterization of infinite episturmian words in a

the set of all infinite words whose factors are (finite) episturmian.
Similarly, we characterize by lexicographic order all balanced infinite words

fading systems is investigated. We show that using the naive lattice decoding
for MIMO systems has considerable deficiencies in terms of the rate-diversity
trade-off. Unlike the case of maximum-likelihood decoding, in this case, even
the perfect lattice space-time codes which have the non-vanishing determinant
property can not achieve the optimal rate-diversity trade-off. Indeed, we show
that in the case of naive lattice decoding, when we fix the underlying lattice,
all the codes based on full-rate lattices have the same rate-diversity
trade-off as V-BLAST. Also, we drive a lower bound on the symbol error
probability of the naive lattice decoding for the fixed-rate MIMO systems (with
equal numbers of receive and transmit antennas). This bound shows that
asymptotically, the naive lattice decoding has an unbounded loss in terms of
the required SNR, compared to the maximum likelihood decoding.

of colors (considered as letters) of its edges that maps the automaton to a
single state. A coloring of edges of a directed graph is synchronizing if the
coloring turns the graph into deterministic finite automaton possessing a
synchronizing word.
  The road coloring problem is a problem of synchronizing coloring of directed
finite strongly connected graph with constant outdegree of all its vertices if
the greatest common divisor of lengths of all its cycles is one. The problem
was posed by Adler, Goodwyn and Weiss over 30 years ago and evoked a noticeable
interest among the specialists in theory of graphs, deterministic automata and
symbolic dynamics. The problem is described even in &quot;Wikipedia&quot; - the popular
Internet Encyclopedia. The positive solution of the road coloring problem is
presented.

hierarchical coding of information, we exemplify how it is remarkably easy to
compute complex objects. Our algorithmic complexity is related to the length of
the class of objects, rather than to the length of the object.

  Networks</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory as
  &quot;Correspondence&quot;</comments><abstract>  Distributed Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes (DOSTBCs) achieving full
diversity order and single-symbol ML decodability have been introduced recently
by Yi and Kim for cooperative networks and an upperbound on the maximal rate of
such codes along with code constructions has been presented. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of Distributed STBCs called Semi-orthogonal Precoded
Distributed Single-Symbol Decodable STBCs (S-PDSSDC) wherein, the source
performs co-ordinate interleaving of information symbols appropriately before
transmitting it to all the relays. It is shown that DOSTBCs are a special case
of S-PDSSDCs. A special class of S-PDSSDCs having diagonal covariance matrix at
the destination is studied and an upperbound on the maximal rate of such codes
is derived. The bounds obtained are approximately twice larger than that of the
DOSTBCs. A systematic construction of S-PDSSDCs is presented when the number of
relays $K \geq 4$. The constructed codes are shown to achieve the upperbound on
the rate when $K$ is of the form 0 or 3 modulo 4. For the rest of the values of
$K$, the constructed codes are shown to have rates higher than that of DOSTBCs.
It is shown that S-PDSSDCs cannot be constructed with any form of linear
processing at the relays when the source doesn't perform co-ordinate
interleaving of the information symbols. Simulation result shows that S-PDSSDCs
have better probability of error performance than that of DOSTBCs.

Y_1,..., Y_m a set of noisy observations of such variables. Assume each
observation Y_a to be a random function of some a random subset of the X_i's,
and consider the conditional distribution of X_i given the observations, namely
\mu_i(x_i)\equiv\prob\{X_i=x_i|Y\} (a posteriori probability).
  We establish a general relation between the distribution of \mu_i, and the
fixed points of the associated density evolution operator. Such relation holds
asymptotically in the large system limit, provided the average number of

can be made so by \emph{untangling} it, that is, by moving some of the vertices
of $G$. Let shift$(G,\delta)$ denote the minimum number of vertices that need
to be moved to untangle $\delta$. We show that shift$(G,\delta)$ is NP-hard to
compute and to approximate. Our hardness results extend to a version of
\textsc{1BendPointSetEmbeddability}, a well-known graph-drawing problem.
  Further we define fix$(G,\delta)=n-shift(G,\delta)$ to be the maximum number
of vertices of a planar $n$-vertex graph $G$ that can be fixed when untangling
$\delta$. We give an algorithm that fixes at least $\sqrt{((\log n)-1)/\log
\log n}$ vertices when untangling a drawing of an $n$-vertex graph $G$. If $G$
is outerplanar, the same algorithm fixes at least $\sqrt{n/2}$ vertices. On the
other hand we construct, for arbitrarily large $n$, an $n$-vertex planar graph
$G$ and a drawing $\delta_G$ of $G$ with fix$(G,\delta_G) \le \sqrt{n-2}+1$ and
an $n$-vertex outerplanar graph $H$ and a drawing $\delta_H$ of $H$ with
fix$(H,\delta_H) \le 2 \sqrt{n-1}+1$. Thus our algorithm is asymptotically
worst-case optimal for outerplanar graphs.

  auctions</title><categories>cs.GT</categories><comments>6 pages</comments><abstract>  One natural constraint in the sponsored search advertising framework arises
from the fact that there is a limit on the number of available slots,
especially for the popular keywords, and as a result, a significant pool of
advertisers are left out. We study the emergence of diversification in the
adword market triggered by such capacity constraints in the sense that new
market mechanisms, as well as, new for-profit agents are likely to emerge to
combat or to make profit from the opportunities created by shortages in
ad-space inventory. We propose a model where the additional capacity is
provided by for-profit agents (or, mediators), who compete for slots in the
original auction, draw traffic, and run their own sub-auctions. The quality of
the additional capacity provided by a mediator is measured by its {\it fitness}
factor. We compute revenues and payoffs for all the different parties at a {\it
symmetric Nash equilibrium} (SNE) when the mediator-based model is operated by
a mechanism currently being used by Google and Yahoo!, and then compare these
numbers with those obtained at a corresponding SNE for the same mechanism, but
without any mediators involved in the auctions. Such calculations allow us to
determine the value of the additional capacity. Our results show that the
revenue of the auctioneer, as well as the social value (i.e. efficiency),
always increase when mediators are involved; moreover even the payoffs of {\em
all} the bidders will increase if the mediator has a high enough fitness. Thus,
our analysis indicates that there are significant opportunities for
diversification in the internet economy and we should expect it to continue to
develop richer structure, with room for different types of agents and
mechanisms to coexist.

networks describing the relationships between individuals. While these
relationships are typically intermittent, previous research has used network
representations that aggregate the relationships at discrete intervals.
However, such an aggregation discards important temporal information, thus
inhibiting our understanding of the networks dynamic behaviour and evolution.
We have recorded patterns of human urban encounter using Bluetooth technology
thus retaining the temporal properties of this network. Here we show how this
temporal information influences the structural properties of the network. We
show that the temporal properties of human urban encounter are scale-free,
leading to an overwhelming proportion of brief encounters between individuals.
While previous research has shown preferential attachment to result in
scale-free connectivity in aggregated network data, we found that scale-free
connectivity results from the temporal properties of the network. In addition,
we show that brief encounters act as weak social ties in the diffusion of
non-expiring information, yet persistent encounters provide the means for
sustaining time-expiring information through a network.

frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based cognitive radio (CR) system is
addressed. According to the prior knowledge of the PU signal known to the
detector, three detection algorithms based on the Neyman-Pearson philosophy are
proposed. In the first case, a Gaussian PU signal with completely known
probability density function (PDF) except for its received power is considered.
The frequency band that the PU signal resides is also assumed known. Detection
is performed individually at each OFDM sub-carrier possibly interfered by the
PU signal, and the results are then combined to form a final decision. In the
second case, the sub-carriers that the PU signal resides are known.
Observations from all possibly interfered sub-carriers are considered jointly
to exploit the fact that the presence of a PU signal interferers all of them
simultaneously. In the last case, it is assumed no PU signal prior knowledge is
available. The detection is involved with a search of the interfered band. The
proposed detector is able to detect an abrupt power change when tracing along
the frequency axis.

bounded-quantum-storage model. On the practical side, simple protocols for
Rabin Oblivious Transfer, 1-2 Oblivious Transfer and Bit Commitment are
presented. No quantum memory is required for honest players, whereas the
protocols can only be broken by an adversary controlling a large amount of
quantum memory. The protocols are efficient, non-interactive and can be
implemented with today's technology.
  On the theoretical side, new entropic uncertainty relations involving
min-entropy are established and used to prove the security of protocols
according to new strong security definitions. For instance, in the realistic
setting of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) against quantum-memory-bounded
eavesdroppers, the uncertainty relation allows to prove the security of QKD
protocols while tolerating considerably higher error rates compared to the
standard model with unbounded adversaries.

natural and manmade complex systems. When each node has full knowledge of the
global network connectivity, finding short communication paths is merely a
matter of distributed computation. However, in many real networks nodes
communicate efficiently even without such global intelligence. Here we show
that the peculiar structural characteristics of many complex networks support
efficient communication without global knowledge. We also describe a general
mechanism that explains this connection between network structure and function.
This mechanism relies on the presence of a metric space hidden behind an
observable network. Our findings suggest that real networks in nature have
underlying metric spaces that remain undiscovered. Their discovery would have
practical applications ranging from routing in the Internet and searching
social networks, to studying information flows in neural, gene regulatory
networks, or signaling pathways.

moving-boundary problems such as free-surface flows or fluid-structure
interaction. This model uses a moving-grid technique to solve the
Navier--Stokes equations expressed in the arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian
kinematics. The discretization in space is based on the spectral element
method. The coupling of the fluid equations and the moving-grid equations is
essentially done through the conditions on the moving boundaries. Two- and
three-dimensional simulations are presented: translation and rotation of a
cylinder in a fluid, and large-amplitude sloshing in a rectangular tank. The
accuracy and robustness of the present numerical model is studied and
discussed.

show that, for any heuristic preserving the Poissonian nature of the underlying

variables for which a search algorithm is likely to find solutions is smaller
than the critical ratio $\alpha_d$ above which solutions are clustered and
highly correlated. In addition we show that the clustering ratio can be reached
when the number k of variables per constraints goes to infinity by the
so-called Generalized Unit Clause heuristic.

We show that the transition between manipulators with 2 and 4 IKS is defined by
the set of manipulators with a quadruple root of their inverse kinematics. The
resulting condition is explicit and states that the last link length of the
manipulator must be greater than a quantity that depends on three of its
remaining DH-parameters. This result is of interest for the design of new
manipulators.

usability studies. Contrastingly, issues relating to the design and ergonomic
evaluation of multimodal output messages combining speech with visual
modalities have not yet been addressed extensively. The experimental study
presented here addresses one of these issues. Its aim is to assess the actual
efficiency and usability of oral system messages including brief spatial
information for helping users to locate objects on crowded displays rapidly.
Target presentation mode, scene spatial structure and task difficulty were
chosen as independent variables. Two conditions were defined: the visual target
presentation mode (VP condition) and the multimodal target presentation mode
(MP condition). Each participant carried out two blocks of visual search tasks
(120 tasks per block, and one block per condition). Scene target presentation
mode, scene structure and task difficulty were found to be significant factors.
Multimodal target presentation proved to be more efficient than visual target
presentation. In addition, participants expressed very positive judgments on
multimodal target presentations which were preferred to visual presentations by
a majority of participants. Besides, the contribution of spatial messages to
visual search speed and accuracy was influenced by scene spatial structure and
task difficulty: (i) messages improved search efficiency to a lesser extent for
2D array layouts than for some other symmetrical layouts, although the use of
2D arrays for displaying pictures is currently prevailing; (ii) message
usefulness increased with task difficulty. Most of these results are
statistically significant.

quantum setting. In particular, we give a new, simulation-based, definition for
security in the bounded-quantum-storage model, and show that this definition
allows for sequential composition of protocols. Damgard et al. (FOCS '05,
CRYPTO '07) showed how to securely implement bit commitment and oblivious
transfer in the bounded-quantum-storage model, where the adversary is only
allowed to store a limited number of qubits. However, their security
definitions did only apply to the standalone setting, and it was not clear if
their protocols could be composed. Indeed, we first give a simple attack that
shows that these protocols are not composable without a small refinement of the
model. Finally, we prove the security of their randomized oblivious transfer
protocol in our refined model. Secure implementations of oblivious transfer and
bit commitment then follow easily by a (classical) reduction to randomized
oblivious transfer.

only local knowledge. It has been shown that for a graph to be navigable, its
construction needs to meet strict criteria. Since such graphs nevertheless seem
to appear in nature, it is of interest to understand why these criteria should
be fulfilled.
  In this paper we present a simple method for constructing graphs based on a
model where nodes vertices are ``similar'' in two different ways, and tend to
connect to those most similar to them - or cluster - with respect to both. We
prove that this leads to navigable networks for several cases, and hypothesize
that it also holds in great generality. Enough generality, perhaps, to explain
the occurrence of navigable networks in nature.

about their opponents. We model such interactions as Bayesian interference
games. Each wireless device selects a power profile over the entire available
bandwidth to maximize its data rate. Such competitive models represent
situations in which several wireless devices share spectrum without any central
authority or coordinated protocol.
  In contrast to games where devices have complete information about their
opponents, we consider scenarios where the devices are unaware of the
interference they cause to other devices. Such games, which are modeled as
Bayesian games, can exhibit significantly different equilibria. We first
consider a simple scenario of simultaneous move games, where we show that the
unique Bayes-Nash equilibrium is where both devices spread their power equally
across the entire bandwidth. We then extend this model to a two-tiered spectrum
sharing case where users act sequentially. Here one of the devices, called the
primary user, is the owner of the spectrum and it selects its power profile
first. The second device (called the secondary user) then responds by choosing
a power profile to maximize its Shannon capacity. In such sequential move
games, we show that there exist equilibria in which the primary user obtains a
higher data rate by using only a part of the bandwidth.
  In a repeated Bayesian interference game, we show the existence of reputation
effects: an informed primary user can bluff to prevent spectrum usage by a
secondary user who suffers from lack of information about the channel gains.
The resulting equilibrium can be highly inefficient, suggesting that
competitive spectrum sharing is highly suboptimal.

  ISIT 2007, Nice, France</comments><acm-class>H.1.1</acm-class><abstract>  In this work, we consider a partially cooperative relay broadcast channel
(PC-RBC) controlled by random parameters. We provide rate regions for two
different situations: 1) when side information (SI) S^n on the random
parameters is non-causally known at both the source and the relay and, 2) when
side information S^n is non-causally known at the source only. These achievable
regions are derived for the general discrete memoryless case first and then
extended to the case when the channel is degraded Gaussian and the SI is
additive i.i.d. Gaussian. In this case, the source uses generalized dirty paper
coding (GDPC), i.e., DPC combined with partial state cancellation, when only
the source is informed, and DPC alone when both the source and the relay are
informed. It appears that, even though it can not completely eliminate the
effect of the SI (in contrast to the case of source and relay being informed),
GDPC is particularly useful when only the source is informed.

of quantitative beliefs into quantitative ones for solving the problem.

important task in neuroscience. For such an analysis, it is important to
unearth interesting regularities in the spiking patterns. In this report, we
present an efficient method for automatically discovering synchrony, synfire
chains, and more general sequences of neuronal firings. We use the Frequent
Episode Discovery framework of Laxman, Sastry, and Unnikrishnan (2005), in
which the episodes are represented and recognized using finite-state automata.
Many aspects of functional connectivity between neuronal populations can be
inferred from the episodes. We demonstrate these using simulated multi-neuronal
data from a Poisson model. We also present a method to assess the statistical
significance of the discovered episodes. Since the Temporal Data Mining (TDM)
methods used in this report can analyze data from hundreds and potentially
thousands of neurons, we argue that this framework is appropriate for
discovering the `Neural Code'.

capacity-approaching low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensembles whose
transmission takes place over memoryless binary-input output-symmetric (MBIOS)
channels. Properties of the degree distributions, graphical complexity and the
number of fundamental cycles in the bipartite graphs are considered via the
derivation of information-theoretic bounds. These bounds are expressed in terms
of the target block/ bit error probability and the gap (in rate) to capacity.
Most of the bounds are general for any decoding algorithm, and some others are
proved under belief propagation (BP) decoding. Proving these bounds under a
certain decoding algorithm, validates them automatically also under any
sub-optimal decoding algorithm. A proper modification of these bounds makes
them universal for the set of all MBIOS channels which exhibit a given
capacity. Bounds on the degree distributions and graphical complexity apply to
finite-length LDPC codes and to the asymptotic case of an infinite block
length. The bounds are compared with capacity-approaching LDPC code ensembles
under BP decoding, and they are shown to be informative and are easy to
calculate. Finally, some interesting open problems are considered.

proposed, which are based on data compressors. For homogeneity testing the idea
is to compress the binary string obtained by ordering the two joint samples and
writing 0 if the element is from the first sample and 1 if it is from the
second sample and breaking ties by randomization (extension to the case of
multiple samples is straightforward). $H_0$ should be rejected if the string is
compressed (to a certain degree) and accepted otherwise. We show that such a
test obtained from an ideal data compressor is valid against all alternatives.
Component independence is reduced to homogeneity testing by constructing two
samples, one of which is the first half of the original and the other is the
second half with one of the components randomly permuted.

  Invited Lecture for Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) and Discovery

function as follows. They store all sensory observations as they come - the
data is holy. At any time, given some agent's current coding capabilities, part
of the data is compressible by a short and hopefully fast program / description
/ explanation / world model. In the agent's subjective eyes, such data is more
regular and more &quot;beautiful&quot; than other data. It is well-known that knowledge
of regularity and repeatability may improve the agent's ability to plan actions
leading to external rewards. In absence of such rewards, however, known beauty
is boring. Then &quot;interestingness&quot; becomes the first derivative of subjective
beauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly
apparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful.
Such progress in compressibility is measured and maximized by the curiosity
drive: create action sequences that extend the observation history and yield
previously unknown / unpredictable but quickly learnable algorithmic
regularity. We discuss how all of the above can be naturally implemented on
computers, through an extension of passive unsupervised learning to the case of
active data selection: we reward a general reinforcement learner (with access
to the adaptive compressor) for actions that improve the subjective
compressibility of the growing data. An unusually large breakthrough in
compressibility deserves the name &quot;discovery&quot;. The &quot;creativity&quot; of artists,
dancers, musicians, pure mathematicians can be viewed as a by-product of this
principle. Several qualitative examples support this hypothesis.

  with Non-Uniform Path Loss and Multipath Propagation</title><categories>cs.NI</categories><comments>To appear in Ad Hoc Networks</comments><journal-ref>Ad Hoc Networks, May 2010, volume 8, issue 3, pages 280-294.</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Each node in a wireless multi-hop network can adjust the power level at which
it transmits and thus change the topology of the network to save energy by
choosing the neighbors with which it directly communicates. Many previous
algorithms for distributed topology control have assumed an ability at each
node to deduce some location-based information such as the direction and the
distance of its neighbor nodes with respect to itself. Such a deduction of
location-based information, however, cannot be relied upon in real environments
where the path loss exponents vary greatly leading to significant errors in
distance estimates. Also, multipath effects may result in different signal
paths with different loss characteristics, and none of these paths may be
line-of-sight, making it difficult to estimate the direction of a neighboring
node. In this paper, we present Step Topology Control (STC), a simple
distributed topology control algorithm which reduces energy consumption while
preserving the connectivity of a heterogeneous sensor network without use of
any location-based information. We show that the STC algorithm achieves the
same or better order of communication and computational complexity when
compared to other known algorithms that also preserve connectivity without the
use of location-based information. We also present a detailed simulation-based
comparative analysis of the energy savings and interference reduction achieved
by the algorithms. The results show that, in spite of not incurring a higher
communication or computational complexity, the STC algorithm performs better
than other algorithms in uniform wireless environments and especially better
when path loss characteristics are non-uniform.

abstract 4-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean information space (4-DPIES) with using
special relativity (SR) methods. This purpose core postulates of existence
4-DPIES are formulated. The theorem setting existence criteria of the invariant
velocity of the information transference is formulated and proved. One more
theorem allowed relating discrete parameters of information and continuous
space-time treating and also row of supplementary theorems is formulated and
proved. For description of dynamics and interaction of information, in article
is introduced general parameter of information - generalized information
emotion (GIE), reminding simultaneously on properties the mass and the charge.
At performing calculation of information observable parameters in the
information space is introduced continual integration methods of Feynman. The
applying idea about existence of GIE as measures of the information inertness
and the interaction carrier, and using continual integration methods of Feynman
can be calculated probability of information process in 4-DPIES. In this frame
presented approach has allowed considering information systems when interest is
presented with information processes, their related with concrete definition
without necessity. The relation between 4-DPIES and real systems parameters is
set at modelling of matching between observable processes and real phenomena
from information interpretation.

Constraint Satisfaction problems, such as Sphere Packing, K-SAT and Graph
Coloring. This geometric construction reexpresses these problems in the more
familiar terms of optimization in rugged energy landscapes. In particular, it
allows one to understand the puzzling fact that unsophisticated programs are
successful well beyond what was considered to be the `hard' transition, and
suggests an algorithm defining a new, higher, easy-hard frontier.

spectral and mortar element method C++ toolbox is presented. The focus is put
on the performance evaluation of several aspects with a particular emphasis on
the parallel efficiency. The performance evaluation is analyzed and compared to
predictions given by a heuristic model, the so-called Gamma model. A
tailor-made CFD computation benchmark case is introduced and used to carry out
this review, stressing the particular interest for commodity clusters.
Conclusions are drawn from this extensive series of analyses and modeling
leading to specific recommendations concerning such toolbox development and
parallel implementation.

called Sudoku 4ALL. With this special interface a person can control the game
with the voice or with a single switch. Our research aims to cautiously search
for issues that might be appropriate for computational support and to build
enabling technologies that increase individuals' functional independence in a

when they studied random network coding. They also introduced constant
dimension codes and demonstrated that these codes can be employed to correct
errors and/or erasures over the operator channel. Constant dimension codes are
equivalent to the so-called linear authentication codes introduced by Wang,
Xing and Safavi-Naini when constructing distributed authentication systems in
2003. In this paper, we study constant dimension codes. It is shown that
Steiner structures are optimal constant dimension codes achieving the
Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound. Furthermore, we show that constant dimension
codes achieve the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound if and only if they are certain
Steiner structures. Then, we derive two Johnson type upper bounds, say I and
II, on constant dimension codes. The Johnson type bound II slightly improves on
the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound. Finally, we point out that a family of known
Steiner structures is actually a family of optimal constant dimension codes
achieving both the Johnson type bounds I and II.

restrictions on the scope of PCL, and imply that some currently claimed PCL

possible, we propose solutions for these problems.

method designed to support real-time navigational features within advanced
driving-assistance systems. Managing multihypotheses is a useful strategy for
the road-matching problem. The multi-sensor fusion and multi-modal estimation
are realized using Dynamical Bayesian Network. Experimental results, using data
from Antilock Braking System (ABS) sensors, a differential Global Positioning

performances of this approach, especially in ambiguous situations.

consider the problem of segmenting a sequence in up to K segments. We want
segments to be as monotonic as possible and to alternate signs. We propose a
quality metric for this problem using the l_inf norm, and we present an optimal
linear time algorithm based on novel formalism. Moreover, given a
precomputation in time O(n log n) consisting of a labeling of all extrema, we
compute any optimal segmentation in constant time. We compare experimentally
its performance to two piecewise linear segmentation heuristics (top-down and
bottom-up). We show that our algorithm is faster and more accurate.
Applications include pattern recognition and qualitative modeling.

  2008</journal-ref><abstract>  Many systems can be described in terms of networks of discrete elements and
their various relationships to one another. A semantic network, or
multi-relational network, is a directed labeled graph consisting of a
heterogeneous set of entities connected by a heterogeneous set of
relationships. Semantic networks serve as a promising general-purpose modeling
substrate for complex systems. Various standardized formats and tools are now
available to support practical, large-scale semantic network models. First, the
Resource Description Framework (RDF) offers a standardized semantic network
data model that can be further formalized by ontology modeling languages such
as RDF Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the recent
introduction of highly performant triple-stores (i.e. semantic network
databases) allows semantic network models on the order of $10^9$ edges to be
efficiently stored and manipulated. RDF and its related technologies are
currently used extensively in the domains of computer science, digital library
science, and the biological sciences. This article will provide an introduction
to RDF/RDFS/OWL and an examination of its suitability to model discrete element
complex systems.

on arbitrary graphs. We prove that, whenever the linear programming (LP)
relaxation of the problem has no fractional solutions, then the belief
propagation (BP) algorithm converges to the correct solution. We also show that
when the LP relaxation has a fractional solution then the BP algorithm can be
used to solve the LP relaxation. Our proof is based on the notion of graph
covers and extends the analysis of (Bayati-Shah-Sharma 2005 and Huang-Jebara
2007}.
  These results are notable in the following regards: (1) It is one of a very
small number of proofs showing correctness of BP without any constraint on the
graph structure. (2) Variants of the proof work for both synchronous and
asynchronous BP; it is the first proof of convergence and correctness of an
asynchronous BP algorithm for a combinatorial optimization problem.

deterministic finite automaton (DFA) if w sends all states of the automaton on
a unique state. Jan Cerny had found in 1964 a sequence of n-state complete DFA
with shortest synchronizing word of length (n-1)^2. He had conjectured that it
is an upper bound for the length of the shortest synchronizing word for any
$n$-state complete DFA.
  The examples of DFA with shortest synchronizing word of length (n-1)^2 are
relatively rare. To the Cerny sequence were added in all examples of Cerny,
Piricka and Rosenauerova (1971), of Kari (2001) and of Roman (2004).
  By help of a program based on some effective algorithms, a wide class of
automata of size less than 11 was checked. The order of the algorithm finding
synchronizing word is quadratic for overwhelming majority of known to date
automata. Some new examples of n-state DFA with minimal synchronizing word of
length (n-1)^2 were discovered. The program recognized some remarkable trends
concerning the length of the minimal synchronizing word.

tracing atom occurrences and forgetting the logical structure. We study simple
manipulations of atomic flows that correspond to complex reductions on
derivations. This allows us to prove, for propositional logic, a new and very
general normalisation theorem, which contains cut elimination as a special
case. We operate in deep inference, which is more general than other syntactic
paradigms, and where normalisation is more difficult to control. We argue that
atomic flows are a significant technical advance for normalisation theory,
because 1) the technique they support is largely independent of syntax; 2)
indeed, it is largely independent of logical inference rules; 3) they
constitute a powerful geometric formalism, which is more intuitive than syntax.

Gaussian channels estimation. The aim of this paper is to study the application
of similar methods to Poisson channels. In particular we compute the Bayesian
estimator of a Poisson channel using the likelihood ratio and the discrete
Malliavin gradient. This algorithm is suitable for numerical implementation via
the Monte-Carlo scheme. As an application we provide an new proof of the
formula obtained recently by Guo, Shamai and Verdu\'u relating some derivatives
of the input-output mutual information of a time-continuous Poisson channel and
the conditional mean estimator of the input. These results are then extended to
mixed Gaussian-Poisson channels.

of large scale graph based data such as WWW, social networks, biological
networks. In the study of graph based data management, node disjoint subgraph
homeomorphism relation between graphs is more suitable than (sub)graph
isomorphism in many cases, especially in those cases that node skipping and
node mismatching are allowed. However, no efficient node disjoint subgraph
homeomorphism determination (ndSHD) algorithms have been available. In this
paper, we propose two computationally efficient ndSHD algorithms based on state
spaces searching with backtracking, which employ many heuristics to prune the
search spaces. Experimental results on synthetic data sets show that the
proposed algorithms are efficient, require relative little time in most of the
testing cases, can scale to large or dense graphs, and can accommodate to more
complex fuzzy matching cases.

matrix $A+B$ is at most $k$. We consider the problem of enumerating the Nash
equilibria in (non-degenerate) games of rank 1. In particular, we show that
even for games of rank 1 not all equilibria can be reached by a Lemke-Howson
path and present a parametric simplex-type algorithm for enumerating all Nash
equilibria of a non-degenerate game of rank 1.

Computing world, linear algebra algorithms have to be reformulated or new
algorithms have to be developed in order to take advantage of the architectural
features on these new processors. Fine grain parallelism becomes a major
requirement and introduces the necessity of loose synchronization in the
parallel execution of an operation. This paper presents an algorithm for the
Cholesky, LU and QR factorization where the operations can be represented as a
sequence of small tasks that operate on square blocks of data. These tasks can
be dynamically scheduled for execution based on the dependencies among them and
on the availability of computational resources. This may result in an out of
order execution of the tasks which will completely hide the presence of
intrinsically sequential tasks in the factorization. Performance comparisons
are presented with the LAPACK algorithms where parallelism can only be
exploited at the level of the BLAS operations and vendor implementations.

distinguishing feature is being based on circuits, as opposed to the more
traditional approaches that deal with tree-like objects such as formulas or
sequents. Among its advantages are greater efficiency, flexibility and
expressiveness. This paper presents a detailed elaboration of a deep-inference
cirquent logic, which is naturally and inherently resource conscious. It shows
that classical logic, both syntactically and semantically, is just a special,
conservative fragment of this more general and, in a sense, more basic logic --
the logic of resources in the form of cirquent calculus. The reader will find
various arguments in favor of switching to the new framework, such as arguments
showing the insufficiency of the expressive power of linear logic or other
formula-based approaches to developing resource logics, exponential
improvements over the traditional approaches in both representational and proof
complexities offered by cirquent calculus, and more. Among the main purposes of
this paper is to provide an introductory-style starting point for what, as the
author wishes to hope, might have a chance to become a new line of research in
proof theory -- a proof theory based on circuits instead of formulas.

Berger has an interpretation only for typed terms or alternatively has an

normalisation. As a main application, we show that Martin-L\&quot;{o}f dependent

graphs. Rank-width is an equivalent complexity measure for undirected graphs
and has good algorithmic and structural properties. It is in particular related
to the vertex-minor relation. We discuss an extension of the notion of
rank-width to edge-colored graphs. A C-colored graph is a graph where the arcs
are colored with colors from the set C. There is not a natural notion of
rank-width for C-colored graphs. We define two notions of rank-width for them,
both based on a coding of C-colored graphs by edge-colored graphs where each
edge has exactly one color from a field F and named respectively F-rank-width
and F-bi-rank-width. The two notions are equivalent to clique-width. We then
present a notion of vertex-minor for F-colored graphs and prove that F-colored
graphs of bounded F-rank-width are characterised by a finite list of F-colored
graphs to exclude as vertex-minors. A cubic-time algorithm to decide whether a
F-colored graph has F-rank-width (resp. F-bi-rank-width) at most k, for fixed
k, is also given. Graph operations to check MSOL-definable properties on
F-colored graphs of bounded rank-width are presented. A specialisation of all
these notions to (directed) graphs without edge colors is presented, which
shows that our results generalise the ones in undirected graphs.

  Theory</comments><abstract>  The large majority of commercially available multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) radio channel measurement devices (sounders) is based on time-division
multiplexed switching (TDMS) of a single transmit/receive radio-frequency chain
into the elements of a transmit/receive antenna array. While being
cost-effective, such a solution can cause significant measurement errors due to
phase noise and frequency offset in the local oscillators. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the resulting errors and show that, in practice,
overestimation of channel capacity by several hundred percent can occur.
Overestimation is caused by phase noise (and to a lesser extent frequency
offset) leading to an increase of the MIMO channel rank. Our analysis
furthermore reveals that the impact of phase errors is, in general, most
pronounced if the physical channel has low rank (typical for line-of-sight or
poor scattering scenarios). The extreme case of a rank-1 physical channel is
analyzed in detail. Finally, we present measurement results obtained from a
commercially employed TDMS-based MIMO channel sounder. In the light of the
findings of this paper, the results obtained through MIMO channel measurement
campaigns using TDMS-based channel sounders should be interpreted with great
care.

from the tripartite W states. We emphasize that reliable teleportation after
our protocol between two communication parties depends on the agreement of the
supervisor to cooperate via taking the W states as both the quantum channel and
eavesdropping detector. The security against typical individual eavesdropping
attacks is proved and its experimental feasibility is briefly illustrated.

inductive reasoning, which includes hypothesis testing and confirmation,
parameter estimation, sequence prediction, classification, and regression. But
standard statistical guidelines for choosing the model class and prior are not
always available or fail, in particular in complex situations. Solomonoff
completed the Bayesian framework by providing a rigorous, unique, formal, and
universal choice for the model class and the prior. We discuss in breadth how
and in which sense universal (non-i.i.d.) sequence prediction solves various
(philosophical) problems of traditional Bayesian sequence prediction. We show
that Solomonoff's model possesses many desirable properties: Strong total and
weak instantaneous bounds, and in contrast to most classical continuous prior
densities has no zero p(oste)rior problem, i.e. can confirm universal
hypotheses, is reparametrization and regrouping invariant, and avoids the
old-evidence and updating problem. It even performs well (actually better) in
non-computable environments.

hard constraint satisfaction problems on sparse random graphs. In such
applications, variables are fixed sequentially to satisfy the constraints.
Message passing is run after each step. Its outcome provides an heuristic to
make choices at next step. This approach has been referred to as `decimation,'
with reference to analogous procedures in statistical physics.
  The behavior of decimation procedures is poorly understood. Here we consider
a simple randomized decimation algorithm based on belief propagation (BP), and
analyze its behavior on random k-satisfiability formulae. In particular, we
propose a tree model for its analysis and we conjecture that it provides
asymptotically exact predictions in the limit of large instances. This
conjecture is confirmed by numerical simulations.

systems. The proposed algorithm can be used for any constellation (QAM or PSK)
and any labeling method. The decoder is based on matrix-lifting Semi-Definite
Programming (SDP). The strength of the proposed method lies in a new relaxation
algorithm applied to the method of Mobasher et al. This results in a reduction
of the number of variables from $(NK+1)^2$ to $(2N+K)^2$, where $N$ is the
number of antennas and $K$ is the number of constellation points in each real
dimension. Since the computational complexity of solving SDP is a polynomial
function of the number of variables, we have a significant complexity
reduction. Moreover, the proposed method offers a better performance as
compared to the best quasi-maximum likelihood decoding methods reported in the
literature.

Transaction Logic (a generalization of the regular Horn logic programs with
state updates). We present two complementary methods for optimizing the
implementation of Transaction Logic. The first method is based on tabling and
we modified the proof theory to table calls and answers on states (practically,
equivalent to dynamic programming). The call-answer table is indexed on the
call and a signature of the state in which the call was made. The answer
columns contain the answer unification and a signature of the state after the
call was executed. The states are signed efficiently using a technique based on
tries and counting. The second method is based on incremental evaluation and it
applies when the data oracle contains derived relations. The deletions and
insertions (executed in the transaction oracle) change the state of the
database. Using the heuristic of inertia (only a part of the state changes in
response to elementary updates), most of the time it is cheaper to compute only
the changes in the state than to recompute the entire state from scratch. The
two methods are complementary by the fact that the first method optimizes the
evaluation when a call is repeated in the same state, and the second method
optimizes the evaluation of a new state when a call-state pair is not found by
the tabling mechanism (i.e. the first method). The proof theory of Transaction
Logic with the application of tabling and incremental evaluation is sound and
complete with respect to its model theory.

under uncertainty and for combining information expressed in natural language
through linguistic labels. In this work, two possible enrichments (quantitative
and/or qualitative) of linguistic labels are considered and operators
(addition, multiplication, division, etc) for dealing with them are proposed
and explained. We denote them $qe$-operators, $qe$ standing for
&quot;qualitative-enriched&quot; operators. These operators can be seen as a direct
extension of the classical qualitative operators ($q$-operators) proposed
recently in the Dezert-Smarandache Theory of plausible and paradoxist reasoning
(DSmT). $q$-operators are also justified in details in this paper. The
quantitative enrichment of linguistic label is a numerical supporting degree in
$[0,\infty)$, while the qualitative enrichment takes its values in a finite
ordered set of linguistic values. Quantitative enrichment is less precise than
qualitative enrichment, but it is expected more close with what human experts
can easily provide when expressing linguistic labels with supporting degrees.
Two simple examples are given to show how the fusion of qualitative-enriched
belief assignments can be done.

automated landing at unusual attitudes. By leveraging the increased agility of
small air vehicles, we show that it is possible to automatically land a small
helicopter on surfaces pitched at angles up to 60 degrees. Such maneuvers
require considerable agility from the vehicle and its avionics system, and they
pose significant technical and safety challenges. Our work builds upon previous
activities in human-inspired, high-agility flight for small rotorcraft.
However, it was not possible to leverage manual flight test data to extract
landing maneuvers due to stringent attitude and position control requirements.
Availability of low-cost, local navigation systems requiring no on-board
instrumentation has proven particularly important for these experiments to be
successful.

processing. If a video sequence or some training set other than the given
low-resolution image is available, this kind of extra information can greatly
aid in the reconstruction of the high-resolution image. The problem is
substantially more difficult with only a single low-resolution image on hand.
The image reconstruction methods designed primarily for denoising is
insufficient for super-resolution problem in the sense that it tends to
oversmooth images with essentially no noise. We propose a new adaptive linear
interpolation method based on variational method and inspired by local linear
embedding (LLE). The experimental result shows that our method avoids the
problem of oversmoothing and preserves image structures well.

not contain factors of the form $xvxvx$, where $x \in A$ and $v \in A^*$. We
analyze the asymptotic growth of the number $u_n$ of overlap-free words of
length $n$ as $ n \to \infty$. We obtain explicit formulas for the minimal and
maximal rates of growth of $u_n$ in terms of spectral characteristics (the
lower spectral radius and the joint spectral radius) of certain sets of
matrices of dimension $20 \times 20$. Using these descriptions we provide new
estimates of the rates of growth that are within 0.4% and $0.03 %$ of their
exact values. The best previously known bounds were within 11% and 3%
respectively. We then prove that the value of $u_n$ actually has the same rate
of growth for ``almost all'' natural numbers $n$. This ``average'' growth is
distinct from the maximal and minimal rates and can also be expressed in terms
of a spectral quantity (the Lyapunov exponent). We use this expression to
estimate it. In order to obtain our estimates, we introduce new algorithms to
compute spectral characteristics of sets of matrices. These algorithms can be
used in other contexts and are of independent interest.

  spaces</title><categories>cs.CV</categories><proxy>ccsd inria-00171686</proxy><abstract>  Kernel estimation techniques, such as mean shift, suffer from one major
drawback: the kernel bandwidth selection. The bandwidth can be fixed for all
the data set or can vary at each points. Automatic bandwidth selection becomes
a real challenge in case of multidimensional heterogeneous features. This paper
presents a solution to this problem. It is an extension of \cite{Comaniciu03a}
which was based on the fundamental property of normal distributions regarding
the bias of the normalized density gradient. The selection is done iteratively
for each type of features, by looking for the stability of local bandwidth
estimates across a predefined range of bandwidths. A pseudo balloon mean shift
filtering and partitioning are introduced. The validity of the method is
demonstrated in the context of color image segmentation based on a
5-dimensional space.

satisfies some conditions, the multiresolution algorithm MR will have a
complexity lower than the complexity of A. In particular, we show that if A has
a O(N2/K) complexity (the complexity of a reduced search dynamic solution
approach), where N and K are respectively the initial and the final number of
segments, the complexity of MR is in O(N).We experimentally compare the
outcomes of MR with those of the optimal &quot;full search&quot; dynamic programming
solution and of classical merge and split approaches. The experimental
evaluations confirm the theoretical derivations and show that the proposed
approach evaluated on 2D coastal maps either shows a lower complexity or
provides polygonal approximations closer to the initial curves.

described by dynamical systems in metric mental space. We apply the mental
space approach for modeling of flows of unconscious and conscious information
in the human brain. In a series of models, Models 1-4, we consider cognitive
systems with increasing complexity of psychological behavior determined by
structure of flows of ideas. Since our models are in fact models of the
AI-type, one immediately recognizes that they can be used for creation of
AI-systems, which we call psycho-robots, exhibiting important elements of human
psyche. Creation of such psycho-robots may be useful improvement of domestic
robots. At the moment domestic robots are merely simple working devices (e.g.
vacuum cleaners or lawn mowers) . However, in future one can expect demand in
systems which be able not only perform simple work tasks, but would have
elements of human self-developing psyche. Such AI-psyche could play an
important role both in relations between psycho-robots and their owners as well
as between psycho-robots. Since the presence of a huge numbers of
psycho-complexes is an essential characteristic of human psychology, it would
be interesting to model them in the AI-framework.

structure that subdivides the embedding space into regions, each region
consisting of the points that are closer to a given object than to the others.
We may define many variants of Voronoi diagrams depending on the class of
objects, the distance functions and the embedding space. In this paper, we
investigate a framework for defining and building Voronoi diagrams for a broad
class of distance functions called Bregman divergences. Bregman divergences
include not only the traditional (squared) Euclidean distance but also various
divergence measures based on entropic functions. Accordingly, Bregman Voronoi
diagrams allow to define information-theoretic Voronoi diagrams in statistical
parametric spaces based on the relative entropy of distributions. We define
several types of Bregman diagrams, establish correspondences between those
diagrams (using the Legendre transformation), and show how to compute them
efficiently. We also introduce extensions of these diagrams, e.g. k-order and
k-bag Bregman Voronoi diagrams, and introduce Bregman triangulations of a set
of points and their connexion with Bregman Voronoi diagrams. We show that these
triangulations capture many of the properties of the celebrated Delaunay
triangulation. Finally, we give some applications of Bregman Voronoi diagrams
which are of interest in the context of computational geometry and machine
learning.

(LPIC) can be seen as a linear matrix filter, we propose new linear matrix
filters that can result in improved bit error performance compared to other
LPICs in the literature. The motivation for the proposed filters arises from
the possibility of avoiding the generation of certain interference and noise
terms in a given stage that would have been present in a conventional LPIC
(CLPIC). In the proposed filters, we achieve such avoidance of the generation
of interference and noise terms in a given stage by simply making the diagonal
elements of a certain matrix in that stage equal to zero. Hence, the proposed
filters do not require additional complexity compared to the CLPIC, and they
can allow achieving a certain error performance using fewer LPIC stages. We
also extend the proposed matrix filter solutions to a multicarrier DS-CDMA
system, where we consider two types of receivers. In one receiver (referred to
as Type-I receiver), LPIC is performed on each subcarrier first, followed by
multicarrier combining (MCC). In the other receiver (called Type-II receiver),
MCC is performed first, followed by LPIC. We show that in both Type-I and
Type-II receivers, the proposed matrix filters outperform other matrix filters.
Also, Type-II receiver performs better than Type-I receiver because of enhanced
accuracy of the interference estimates achieved due to frequency diversity
offered by MCC.

location updates generate by mobile nodes in IEEE802.11-based wireless mesh
networks. Existing location services use node identifiers to determine the
locator (aka anchor) that is responsible for keeping track of a node's
location. Such a strategy can be inefficient because: (i) identifiers give no
clue on the node's mobility and (ii) locators can be far from the
source/destination shortest path, which increases both location delays and
bandwidth consumption. To solve these issues, Otiy introduces a new strategy
that identifies nodes to play the role of locators based on the likelihood of a
destination to be close to these nodes- i.e., locators are identified depending
on the mobility pattern of nodes. Otiy relies on the cyclic mobility patterns
of nodes and creates a slotted agenda composed of a set of predicted locations,
defined according to the past and present patterns of mobility. Correspondent
nodes fetch this agenda only once and use it as a reference for identifying
which locators are responsible for the node at different points in time. Over a
period of about one year, the weekly proportion of nodes having at least 50% of
exact location predictions is in average about 75%. This proportion increases
by 10% when nodes also consider their closeness to the locator from only what
they know about the network.

recently been focused on stack computation [6, 9], and in particular calls for
a formulation of information-lossless stack or pushdown compressors that allows
a formal analysis of their performance and a more ambitious use of the stack in
XML compression, where so far it is mainly connected to parsing mechanisms. In
this paper we introduce the model of pushdown compressor, based on pushdown
transducers that compute a single injective function while keeping the widest
generality regarding stack computation. The celebrated Lempel-Ziv algorithm
LZ78 [10] was introduced as a general purpose compression algorithm that
outperforms finite-state compressors on all sequences. We compare the
performance of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm with that of the pushdown compressors,
or compression algorithms that can be implemented with a pushdown transducer.
This comparison is made without any a priori assumption on the data's source
and considering the asymptotic compression ratio for infinite sequences. We
prove that Lempel-Ziv is incomparable with pushdown compressors.

morphological, syntactic and ontological language resources to model word
similarity and bootstrap from a seed lexicon. The different methods are
deployed in learning lexical items for a precision grammar, and shown to each
have strengths and weaknesses over different word classes. A particular focus
of this paper is the relative accessibility of different language resource
types, and predicted ``bang for the buck'' associated with each in deep lexical
acquisition applications.

globally optimal decisions, either estimation or detection, through a
self-synchronization mechanism among linearly coupled integrators initialized
with local measurements. We model the interaction among the nodes as a directed
graph with weights (possibly) dependent on the radio channels and we pose
special attention to the effect of the propagation delay occurring in the
exchange of data among sensors, as a function of the network geometry. We
derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the proposed system to reach a
consensus on globally optimal decision statistics. One of the major results
proved in this work is that a consensus is reached with exponential convergence
speed for any bounded delay condition if and only if the directed graph is
quasi-strongly connected. We provide a closed form expression for the global
consensus, showing that the effect of delays is, in general, the introduction
of a bias in the final decision. Finally, we exploit our closed form expression
to devise a double-step consensus mechanism able to provide an unbiased
estimate with minimum extra complexity, without the need to know or estimate
the channel parameters.

network as a collection of selfish, autonomous agents that strategically
interact in order to acquire the dynamically available spectrum opportunities.
Our main focus is on developing solutions for wireless users to successfully
compete with each other for the limited and time-varying spectrum
opportunities, given the experienced dynamics in the wireless network. We
categorize these dynamics into two types: one is the disturbance due to the
environment (e.g. wireless channel conditions, source traffic characteristics,
etc.) and the other is the impact caused by competing users. To analyze the
interactions among users given the environment disturbance, we propose a
general stochastic framework for modeling how the competition among users for
spectrum opportunities evolves over time. At each stage of the dynamic resource
allocation, a central spectrum moderator auctions the available resources and
the users strategically bid for the required resources. The joint bid actions
affect the resource allocation and hence, the rewards and future strategies of
all users. Based on the observed resource allocation and corresponding rewards
from previous allocations, we propose a best response learning algorithm that
can be deployed by wireless users to improve their bidding policy at each
stage. The simulation results show that by deploying the proposed best response
learning algorithm, the wireless users can significantly improve their own
performance in terms of both the packet loss rate and the incurred cost for the
used resources.

brought about by the Internet. Rigorous tests are needed to establish to what
extent sophisticated methods can improve the quality of the predictions. Here
we analyse a refined correlation-based collaborative filtering algorithm and
compare it with a novel spectral method for recommending. We test them on two
databases that bear different statistical properties (MovieLens and Jester)
without filtering out the less active users and ordering the opinions in time,
whenever possible. We find that, when the distribution of user-user
correlations is narrow, simple averages work nearly as well as advanced
methods. Recommender systems can, on the other hand, exploit a great deal of
additional information in systems where external influence is negligible and
peoples' tastes emerge entirely. These findings are validated by simulations
with artificially generated data.

fix-free code for a given sequence of codeword lengths. For a given alphabet,
we obtain the {\em Kraftsum} of a code, if we divide for every length the
number of codewords of this length in the code by the total number of all
possible words of this length and then take summation over all codeword lengths
which appears in the code. The same way the Kraftsum of a lengths sequence
$(l_1,..., l_n) $ is given by $\sum_{i=1}^n q^{-l_i} $, where $q$ is the
numbers of letters in the alphabet. Kraft and McMillan have shown in
\cite{kraft} (1956), that there exists a prefix-free code with codeword lengths
of a certain lengths sequence, if the Kraftsum of the lengths sequence is
smaller than or equal to one. Furthermore they have shown, that the converse
also holds for all (uniquely decipherable) codes.\footnote{In this survey a
code means a set of words, such that any message which is encoded with these
words can be uniquely decoded. Therefore we omit in future the &quot;uniquely
decipherable&quot; and write only &quot;code&quot;.} The question rises, if Kraft's and
McMillan's result can be generalized to other types of codes? Throughout, we
try to give an answer on this question for the class of fix-free codes. Since
any code has Kraftsum smaller than or equal to one, this answers the question
for the second implication of Kraft-McMillan's theorem. Therefore we pay
attention mainly to the first implication.

people came to understand these are the key to a large number of issues in
industry, commerce, home automation, healthcare, agriculture and environment,
monitoring, public safety etc. One of the most challenging research problems in
sensor networks research is power awareness and power-saving techniques. In
this master's thesis, we have studied one particular power-saving technique,
i.e. frequency scaling. In particular, we analysed the close relationship
between clock frequencies in a microcontroller and several types of constraints
imposed on these frequencies, e.g. by other components of the microcontroller,
by protocol specifications, by external factors etc. Among these constraints,
we were especially interested in the ones imposed by the timer service and by
the serial ports' transmission rates. Our efforts resulted in a microcontroller
configuration management tool which aims at assisting application programmers
in choosing microcontroller configurations, in function of the particular needs
and constraints of their application.

central role in such services, especially when they are deployed in sensitive

standards to SOAP-based transfer services is, however, problematic as a
straightforward adoption of SOAP with MTOM introduces considerable
inefficiencies in the signature generation process when large data sets are
involved. This paper proposes a non-blocking, signature generation approach
enabling a stream-like processing with considerable performance enhancements.

  Multi-hop Relay Networks</title><categories>cs.GT</categories><comments>28 pages, 8 figures, submitted to JSAC on Game Theory in
  Communication Systems</comments><abstract>  We study a pricing game in multi-hop relay networks where nodes price their
services and route their traffic selfishly and strategically. In this game,
each node (1) announces pricing functions which specify the payments it demands
from its respective customers depending on the amount of traffic they route to
it and (2) allocates the total traffic it receives to its service providers.
The profit of a node is the difference between the revenue earned from
servicing others and the cost of using others' services. We show that the
socially optimal routing of such a game can always be induced by an equilibrium
where no node can increase its profit by unilaterally changing its pricing
functions or routing decision. On the other hand, there may also exist
inefficient equilibria. We characterize the loss of efficiency by deriving the
price of anarchy at inefficient equilibria. We show that the price of anarchy
is finite for oligopolies with concave marginal cost functions, while it is
infinite for general topologies and cost functions.

networks based on the Alamouti space time code and orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing to combat the effect of timing errors at the relay nodes.
This transmission scheme is amazingly simple and achieves a diversity order of
two for any number of relays. Motivated by its simplicity, this scheme is
extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full
cooperative diversity for any number of relays. The conditions on the
distributed space time code (DSTC) structure that admit its application in the
proposed transmission scheme are identified and it is pointed out that the
recently proposed full diversity four group decodable DSTCs from precoded
co-ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs and extended Clifford algebras
satisfy these conditions. It is then shown how differential encoding at the
source can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme to arrive at a new
transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity in asynchronous
wireless relay networks with no channel information and also no timing error
knowledge at the destination node. Finally, four group decodable distributed
differential space time codes applicable in this new transmission scheme for
power of two number of relays are also provided.

  Capacity scaling laws</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Sept. 2007</comments><abstract>  We address the optimization of the sum rate performance in multicell
interference-limited singlehop networks where access points are allowed to
cooperate in terms of joint resource allocation. The resource allocation
policies considered here combine power control and user scheduling. Although
very promising from a conceptual point of view, the optimization of the sum of
per-link rates hinges, in principle, on tough issues such as computational
complexity and the requirement for heavy receiver-to-transmitter channel
information feedback across all network cells. In this paper, we show that, in
fact, distributed algorithms are actually obtainable in the asymptotic regime
where the numbers of users per cell is allowed to grow large. Additionally,
using extreme value theory, we provide scaling laws for upper and lower bounds
for the network capacity (sum of single user rates over all cells),
corresponding to zero-interference and worst-case interference scenarios. We
show that the scaling is either dominated by path loss statistics or by
small-scale fading, depending on the regime and user location scenario. We show
that upper and lower rate bounds behave in fact identically, asymptotically.
This remarkable result suggests not only that distributed resource allocation
is practically possible but also that the impact of multicell interference on
the capacity (in terms of scaling) actually vanishes asymptotically.

languages, but it must be noted that, as they stand, they do not yield an
algorithm to decide whether a given regular tree language is first-order
definable.

  image sequences</title><categories>cs.CV</categories><proxy>ccsd inria-00173280</proxy><abstract>  High resolution satellite image sequences are multidimensional signals
composed of spatio-temporal patterns associated to numerous and various
phenomena. Bayesian methods have been previously proposed in (Heas and Datcu,
2005) to code the information contained in satellite image sequences in a graph
representation using Bayesian methods. Based on such a representation, this
paper further presents a supervised learning methodology of semantics
associated to spatio-temporal patterns occurring in satellite image sequences.
It enables the recognition and the probabilistic retrieval of similar events.
Indeed, graphs are attached to statistical models for spatio-temporal
processes, which at their turn describe physical changes in the observed scene.
Therefore, we adjust a parametric model evaluating similarity types between
graph patterns in order to represent user-specific semantics attached to
spatio-temporal phenomena. The learning step is performed by the incremental
definition of similarity types via user-provided spatio-temporal pattern
examples attached to positive or/and negative semantics. From these examples,
probabilities are inferred using a Bayesian network and a Dirichlet model. This
enables to links user interest to a specific similarity model between graph
patterns. According to the current state of learning, semantic posterior
probabilities are updated for all possible graph patterns so that similar
spatio-temporal phenomena can be recognized and retrieved from the image
sequence. Few experiments performed on a multi-spectral SPOT image sequence
illustrate the proposed spatio-temporal recognition method.

  Complexity, and Optimizations</title><categories>cs.DB cs.DC cs.DS cs.LO</categories><abstract>  In this study, we address the problem of answering queries over a
peer-to-peer system of taxonomy-based sources. A taxonomy states subsumption
relationships between negation-free DNF formulas on terms and negation-free
conjunctions of terms. To the end of laying the foundations of our study, we
first consider the centralized case, deriving the complexity of the decision
problem and of query evaluation. We conclude by presenting an algorithm that is
efficient in data complexity and is based on hypergraphs. More expressive forms
of taxonomies are also investigated, which however lead to intractability. We
then move to the distributed case, and introduce a logical model of a network
of taxonomy-based sources. On such network, a distributed version of the
centralized algorithm is then presented, based on a message passing paradigm,
and its correctness is proved. We finally discuss optimization issues, and
relate our work to the literature.

We find that the network is infinite- or finite-dimensional depending on

The network becomes one-dimensional when the attachment probability decays
faster than $(age)^{-2}$. We describe structural characteristics of these
phases and transitions between them.

defined by quadratic polynomials. Semi-algebraic sets of $R^k$ are defined as
the smallest family of sets in $R^k$ that contains the algebraic sets as well
as the sets defined by polynomial inequalities, and which is also closed under
the boolean operations (complementation, finite unions and finite
intersections). We prove new bounds on the Betti numbers as well as on the
number of different stable homotopy types of certain fibers of semi-algebraic
sets over a real closed field $R$ defined by quadratic polynomials, in terms of
the parameters of the system of polynomials defining them, which improve the
known results. We conclude the thesis with presenting two new algorithms along
with their implementations. The first algorithm computes the number of
connected components and the first Betti number of a semi-algebraic set defined
by compact objects in $\mathbb{R}^k$ which are simply connected. This algorithm
improves the well-know method using a triangulation of the semi-algebraic set.
Moreover, the algorithm has been efficiently implemented which was not possible
before. The second algorithm computes efficiently the real intersection of
three quadratic surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ using a semi-numerical approach.

importance of a vertex in a network graph in terms of its &quot;control&quot; on the
distribution of information along geodesic paths throughout that network. This
quantity however does not capture how different vertices participate together
in such control. In order to allow for the uncovering of finer details in this
regard, we introduce here an extension of betweenness centrality to pairs of
vertices, which we term co-betweenness, that provides the basis for quantifying
various analogous pairwise notions of importance and control. More
specifically, we motivate and define a precise notion of co-betweenness, we
present an efficient algorithm for its computation, extending the algorithm of
Brandes in a natural manner, and we illustrate the utilization of this
co-betweenness on a handful of different communication networks. From these
real-world examples, we show that the co-betweenness allows one to identify
certain vertices which are not the most central vertices but which,
nevertheless, act as important actors in the relaying and dispatching of
information in the network.

variables. Building quantitative models using these variables most often
requires using a smaller set of variables than the initial one. Indeed, a too
large number of input variables to a model results in a too large number of
parameters, leading to overfitting and poor generalization abilities. In this
paper, we suggest the use of the mutual information measure to select variables
from the initial set. The mutual information measures the information content
in input variables with respect to the model output, without making any
assumption on the model that will be used; it is thus suitable for nonlinear
modelling. In addition, it leads to the selection of variables among the
initial set, and not to linear or nonlinear combinations of them. Without
decreasing the model performances compared to other variable projection
methods, it allows therefore a greater interpretability of the results.

vectors. In those situations, one possible solution is to rely on dissimilarity
measures that enable sensible comparison between observations. Kohonen's
Self-Organizing Map (SOM) has been adapted to data described only through their
dissimilarity matrix. This algorithm provides both non linear projection and
clustering of non vector data. Unfortunately, the algorithm suffers from a high
cost that makes it quite difficult to use with voluminous data sets. In this
paper, we propose a new algorithm that provides an important reduction of the
theoretical cost of the dissimilarity SOM without changing its outcome (the
results are exactly the same as the ones obtained with the original algorithm).
Moreover, we introduce implementation methods that result in very short running
times. Improvements deduced from the theoretical cost model are validated on
simulated and real world data (a word list clustering problem). We also
demonstrate that the proposed implementation methods reduce by a factor up to 3
the running time of the fast algorithm over a standard implementation.

which consists of a transmitter and a receiver with two antennas each, and an
eavesdropper with a single antenna. We determine the secrecy capacity of this
channel by proposing an achievable scheme and then developing a tight upper
bound that meets the proposed achievable secrecy rate. We show that, for this
channel, Gaussian signalling in the form of beam-forming is optimal, and no
pre-processing of information is necessary.

On upper level
we have a very flexible system of windows: we can move them, resize, overlap or
put side by side. At any moment we decide what would be the best view and
reorganize the whole view easily. Then we start any application, go to the
inner level, and everything changes. Here we are stripped of all the
flexibility and can work only inside the scenario, developed by the designer of
the program. Interface will allow us to change some tiny details, but in
general everything is fixed: graphics is neither moveable, nor resizable, and
the same with controls. Author designed an extremely powerful mechanism of
turning graphical objects and controls into moveable and resizable. This can
not only significantly improve the existing applications, but this will bring
the applications to another level. (To estimate the possible difference, try to
imagine the Windows system without its flexibility and compare it with the
current one.) This article explains in details the construction and use of
moveable and resizable graphical objects.

plane, each of which broadcasts a unique key within a fixed angular range, so
that each point in the plane can determine whether it is inside or outside a

In this paper we establish a lower bound of 2n/3 - 1 stations for polygons in

by a fixed number of real values, whereas most of real world observations are
not readily available in such a format. Vector based data analysis methods have
therefore to be adapted in order to be used with non standard complex data. A
flexible and general solution for this adaptation is to use a (dis)similarity
measure. Indeed, thanks to expert knowledge on the studied data, it is
generally possible to define a measure that can be used to make pairwise
comparison between observations. General data analysis methods are then
obtained by adapting existing methods to (dis)similarity matrices. In this
article, we propose an adaptation of Kohonen's Self Organizing Map (SOM) to
(dis)similarity data. The proposed algorithm is an adapted version of the
vector based batch SOM. The method is validated on real world data: we provide
an analysis of the usage patterns of the web site of the Institut National de
Recherche en Informatique et Automatique, constructed thanks to web log mining
method.

  on Communication, Control and Computing, Monticello, IL, September 26 - 28,
  2007</comments><abstract>  Previous work on relay networks has concentrated primarily on the diversity
benefits of such techniques. This paper explores the possibility of also
obtaining multiplexing gain in a relay network, while retaining diversity gain.
Specifically, consider a network in which a single source node is equipped with
one antenna and a destination is equipped with two antennas. It is shown that,
in certain scenarios, by adding a relay with two antennas and using a
successive relaying protocol, the diversity multiplexing tradeoff performance
of the network can be lower bounded by that of a 2 by 2 MIMO channel, when the
decode-and-forward protocol is applied at the relay. A distributed D-BLAST
architecture is developed, in which parallel channel coding is applied to
achieve this tradeoff. A space-time coding strategy, which can bring a maximal
multiplexing gain of more than one, is also derived for this scenario. As will
be shown, while this space-time coding strategy exploits maximal diversity for
a small multiplexing gain, the proposed successive relaying scheme offers a
significant performance advantage for higher data rate transmission. In
addition to the specific results shown here, these ideas open a new direction
for exploiting the benefits of wireless relay networks.

  Background Chemometrics Intell Lab Syst 86, 2 (2007) 208-218</journal-ref><doi>10.1016/j.chemolab.2006.06.007</doi><abstract>  The large number of spectral variables in most data sets encountered in
spectral chemometrics often renders the prediction of a dependent variable
uneasy. The number of variables hopefully can be reduced, by using either
projection techniques or selection methods; the latter allow for the
interpretation of the selected variables. Since the optimal approach of testing
all possible subsets of variables with the prediction model is intractable, an
incremental selection approach using a nonparametric statistics is a good
option, as it avoids the computationally intensive use of the model itself. It
has two drawbacks however: the number of groups of variables to test is still
huge, and colinearities can make the results unstable. To overcome these
limitations, this paper presents a method to select groups of spectral
variables. It consists in a forward-backward procedure applied to the
coefficients of a B-Spline representation of the spectra. The criterion used in
the forward-backward procedure is the mutual information, allowing to find
nonlinear dependencies between variables, on the contrary of the generally used
correlation. The spline representation is used to get interpretability of the
results, as groups of consecutive spectral variables will be selected. The
experiments conducted on NIR spectra from fescue grass and diesel fuels show
that the method provides clearly identified groups of selected variables,
making interpretation easy, while keeping a low computational load. The
prediction performances obtained using the selected coefficients are higher
than those obtained by the same method applied directly to the original
variables and similar to those obtained using traditional models, although
using significantly less spectral variables.

strategy offers a good trade-off between optimality of the selected feature
subset and computation time. However, it requires to set the parameter(s) of
the mutual information estimator and to determine when to halt the forward
procedure. These two choices are difficult to make because, as the
dimensionality of the subset increases, the estimation of the mutual
information becomes less and less reliable. This paper proposes to use
resampling methods, a K-fold cross-validation and the permutation test, to
address both issues. The resampling methods bring information about the
variance of the estimator, information which can then be used to automatically
set the parameter and to calculate a threshold to stop the forward procedure.
The procedure is illustrated on a synthetic dataset as well as on real-world
examples.

to functional data, for example spectra, temporal series, spatio-temporal
images, gesture recognition data, etc. Functional data are rarely known in
practice; usually a regular or irregular sampling is known. For this reason,
some processing is needed in order to benefit from the smooth character of
functional data in the analysis methods. This paper shows how to extend the
Radial-Basis Function Networks (RBFN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models
to functional data inputs, in particular when the latter are known through
lists of input-output pairs. Various possibilities for functional processing
are discussed, including the projection on smooth bases, Functional Principal
Component Analysis, functional centering and reduction, and the use of
differential operators. It is shown how to incorporate these functional
processing into the RBFN and MLP models. The functional approach is illustrated
on a benchmark of spectrometric data analysis.

We obtain consistency results which imply that the estimation of optimal
parameters for functional MLP is statistically well defined. We finally show on
simulated and real world data that the proposed model performs in a very
satisfactory way.

for the reason that static methods have some restrictions. To guarantee high
reliability of some important MPI-based application software, a model of MPI
synchronization communication is abstracted and a type of static method is
devised to examine deadlocks in such modes. The model has three forms with
different complexity: sequential model, single-loop model and nested-loop
model. Sequential model is a base for all models. Single-loop model must be
treated with a special type of equation group and nested-loop model extends the
methods for the other two models. A standard Java-based software framework
originated from these methods is constructed for determining whether MPI
programs are free from synchronization communication deadlocks. Our practice
shows the software framework is better than those tools using dynamic methods
because it can dig out all synchronization communication deadlocks before an
MPI-based program goes into running.

three basic simplified models are also defined. A series of theorems and
methods for deciding whether deadlocks will occur among the three models are
given and proved strictly. These theories and methods for simple models'
deadlock detection are the necessary base for real MPI program deadlock
detection. The methods are based on a static analysis through programs and with
runtime detection in necessary cases and they are able to determine before
compiling whether it will be deadlocked for two of the three basic models. For
another model, some deadlock cases can be found before compiling and others at
runtime. Our theorems can be used to prove the correctness of currently popular
MPI program deadlock detection algorithms. Our methods may decrease codes that
those algorithms need to change to MPI source or profiling interface and may
detects deadlocks ahead of program execution, thus the overheads can be reduced
greatly.

difficult and need building program models. All complex models are based on
sequential models. The sequential model is mapped into a set of character
strings and its deadlock detection problem is translated into an equivalent
multi-queue string matching problem. An algorithm is devised and implemented to
statically detect deadlocks in sequential models of MPI synchronization
communication programs. The time and space complexity of the algorithm is O(n)
where n is the amount of message in model. The algorithm is better than usual
circle-detection methods and can adapt well to dynamic message stream.

strategies) to minimize the total expected distortion over a finite horizon. We

transaction-oriented simulations with a special focus on the space-parallel
approach and discrete event simulation synchronisation algorithms that are
suitable for transaction-oriented simulation and the target environment of Ad
Hoc Grids. To demonstrate the findings a Java-based parallel
transaction-oriented simulator for the simulation language GPSS/H is
implemented on the basis of the most promising Shock Resistant Time Warp
synchronisation algorithm and using the Grid framework ProActive. The
validation of this parallel simulator shows that the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm can successfully reduce the number of rolled back Transaction moves
but it also reveals circumstances in which the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm can be outperformed by the normal Time Warp algorithm. The conclusion
of this paper suggests possible improvements to the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm to avoid such problems.

  Communication, Control and Computing, University of Illinois, Monticello, IL,
  September 27 - 29, 2006</comments><abstract>  Rate and diversity impose a fundamental tradeoff in communications. This
tradeoff was investigated for Intersymbol Interference (ISI) channels in [4]. A
different point of view was explored in [1] where high-rate codes were designed
so that they have a high-diversity code embedded within them. Such diversity
embedded codes were investigated for flat fading channels and in this paper we
explore its application to ISI channels. In particular, we investigate the rate
tuples achievable for diversity embedded codes for scalar ISI channels through
particular coding strategies. The main result of this paper is that the
diversity multiplexing tradeoff for fading ISI channels is indeed successively
refinable. This implies that for fading single input single output (SISO) ISI
channels one can embed a high diversity code within a high rate code without
any performance loss (asymptotically). This is related to a deterministic
structural observation about the asymptotic behavior of frequency response of
channel with respect to fading strength of time domain taps.

  Channels</title><categories>cs.GT</categories><comments>20 pages, 8 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This paper considers the problem of how to allocate power among competing
users sharing a frequency-selective interference channel. We model the
interaction between selfish users as a non-cooperative game. As opposed to the
existing iterative water-filling algorithm that studies the myopic users, this
paper studies how a foresighted user, who knows the channel state information
and response strategies of its competing users, should optimize its
transmission strategy. To characterize this multi-user interaction, the
Stackelberg equilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium
for the investigated non-cooperative game is shown. We analyze this interaction
in more detail using a simple two-user example, where the foresighted user
determines its transmission strategy by solving as a bi-level program which
allows him to account for the myopic user's response. It is analytically shown
that a foresighted user can improve its performance, if it has the necessary
information about its competitors. Since the optimal solution of Stackelberg
equilibrium is computationally prohibitive, we propose a practical
low-complexity approach based on Lagrangian duality theory. Numerical
simulations verify the performance improvements. Possible ways to acquire the
required information and to extend the formulation to more than two users are
also discussed.

in the Linear Programming decoding introduced by Feldman, Karger and
Wainwright. We begin by showing that for expander codes, every fractional
pseudocodeword always has at least a constant fraction of non-integral bits. We
then prove that for expander codes, the active set of any fractional
pseudocodeword is smaller by a constant fraction than the active set of any
codeword. We further exploit these geometrical properties to devise an improved
decoding algorithm with the same complexity order as LP decoding that provably
performs better, for any blocklength. It proceeds by guessing facets of the
polytope, and then resolving the linear program on these facets. While the LP
decoder succeeds only if the ML codeword has the highest likelihood over all
pseudocodewords, we prove that the proposed algorithm, when applied to suitable
expander codes, succeeds unless there exist a certain number of
pseudocodewords, all adjacent to the ML codeword on the LP decoding polytope,
and with higher likelihood than the ML codeword. We then describe an extended
algorithm, still with polynomial complexity, that succeeds as long as there are
at most polynomially many pseudocodewords above the ML codeword.

simplicity, distributed nature, and robustness in noisy and uncertain
environments. However, using standard gossip algorithms can lead to a
significant waste in energy by repeatedly recirculating redundant information.
For realistic sensor network model topologies like grids and random geometric
graphs, the inefficiency of gossip schemes is related to the slow mixing times
of random walks on the communication graph. We propose and analyze an
alternative gossiping scheme that exploits geographic information. By utilizing
geographic routing combined with a simple resampling method, we demonstrate
substantial gains over previously proposed gossip protocols. For regular graphs
such as the ring or grid, our algorithm improves standard gossip by factors of
$n$ and $\sqrt{n}$ respectively. For the more challenging case of random
geometric graphs, our algorithm computes the true average to accuracy
$\epsilon$ using $O(\frac{n^{1.5}}{\sqrt{\log n}} \log \epsilon^{-1})$ radio
transmissions, which yields a $\sqrt{\frac{n}{\log n}}$ factor improvement over
standard gossip algorithms. We illustrate these theoretical results with
experimental comparisons between our algorithm and standard methods as applied
to various classes of random fields.

evolving the classifier without it having to be fully retrained is known as
incremental learning. Incremental learning has been successfully applied to
many classification problems, where the data is changing and is not all
available at once. In this paper there is a comparison between Learn++, which
is one of the most recent incremental learning algorithms, and the new proposed
method of Incremental Learning Using Genetic Algorithm (ILUGA). Learn++ has
shown good incremental learning capabilities on benchmark datasets on which the
new ILUGA method has been tested. ILUGA has also shown good incremental
learning ability using only a few classifiers and does not suffer from
catastrophic forgetting. The results obtained for ILUGA on the Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) and Wine datasets are good, with an overall
accuracy of 93% and 94% respectively showing a 4% improvement over Learn++.MT
for the difficult multi-class OCR dataset.

technique to the land cover mapping community. They have their roots in
Statistical Learning Theory and have gained prominence because they are robust,
accurate and are effective even when using a small training sample. By their
nature SVMs are essentially binary classifiers, however, they can be adopted to
handle the multiple classification tasks common in remote sensing studies. The
two approaches commonly used are the One-Against-One (1A1) and One-Against-All
(1AA) techniques. In this paper, these approaches are evaluated in as far as
their impact and implication for land cover mapping. The main finding from this
research is that whereas the 1AA technique is more predisposed to yielding
unclassified and mixed pixels, the resulting classification accuracy is not
significantly different from 1A1 approach. It is the authors conclusions that
ultimately the choice of technique adopted boils down to personal preference
and the uniqueness of the dataset at hand.

Majority task. This task is a good example of what the phenomenon of emergence
in complex systems is. We take an interest in the reasons that make this
particular fitness landscape a difficult one. The first goal is to study the
landscape as such, and thus it is ideally independent from the actual
heuristics used to search the space. However, a second goal is to understand
the features a good search technique for this particular problem space should
possess. We statistically quantify in various ways the degree of difficulty of
searching this landscape. Due to neutrality, investigations based on sampling
techniques on the whole landscape are difficult to conduct. So, we go exploring
the landscape from the top. Although it has been proved that no CA can perform
the task perfectly, several efficient CAs for this task have been found.
Exploiting similarities between these CAs and symmetries in the landscape, we
define the Olympus landscape which is regarded as the ''heavenly home'' of the
best local optima known (blok). Then we measure several properties of this
subspace. Although it is easier to find relevant CAs in this subspace than in
the overall landscape, there are structural reasons that prevent a searcher
from finding overfitted CAs in the Olympus. Finally, we study dynamics and
performance of genetic algorithms on the Olympus in order to confirm our
analysis and to find efficient CAs for the Majority problem with low
computational cost.

the correlation between fitness of solutions and fitnesses of nearest solutions
according to some neighboring. We focus on the behavior of local search
heuristics, such as hill climber, on the well-known NK fitness landscape. In
both cases the fitness vs. fitness correlation is shown to be related to the
epistatic parameter K.

  Gaussian MAC Channels</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><abstract>  It has been shown lately the optimality of uncoded transmission in estimating
Gaussian sources over homogeneous/symmetric Gaussian multiple access channels
(MAC) using multiple sensors. It remains, however, unclear whether it still
holds for any arbitrary networks and/or with high channel signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and high signal-to-measurement-noise ratio (SMNR). In this paper, we
first provide a joint source and channel coding approach in estimating Gaussian
sources over Gaussian MAC channels, as well as its sufficient and necessary
condition in restoring Gaussian sources with a prescribed distortion value. An
interesting relationship between our proposed joint approach with a more
straightforward separate source and channel coding scheme is then established.
We then formulate constrained power minimization problems and transform them to
relaxed convex geometric programming problems, whose numerical results exhibit
that either separate or uncoded scheme becomes dominant over a linear topology
network. In addition, we prove that the optimal decoding order to minimize the
total transmission powers for both source and channel coding parts is solely
subject to the ranking of MAC channel qualities, and has nothing to do with the
ranking of measurement qualities. Finally, asymptotic results for homogeneous
networks are obtained which not only confirm the existing optimality of the
uncoded approach, but also show that the asymptotic SNR exponents of these
three approaches are all the same. Moreover, the proposed joint approach share
the same asymptotic ratio with respect to high SNR and high SMNR as the uncoded
scheme.

Our framework is designed to easily implement and measure different P2P

discusses our implementation of the Symphony network, which allows each node to
keep $k \le \log N$ shortcut connections and to route to any other node with a
short average delay of $O(\frac{1}{k}\log^2 N)$. %This provides a continuous
trade-off between node degree and routing latency. We present experimental
results taken from several PlanetLab deployments of size up to 1060 nodes.
These succes sful deployments represent some of the largest PlanetLab
deployments of P2P overlays found in the literature, and show our
implementation's robustness to massive node dynamics in a WAN environment.

line) and such that no three points lie on the same axis-parallel line; we call
a graph with such an embedding an xyz graph}. We describe a correspondence
between xyz graphs and face-colored embeddings of the graph onto
two-dimensional manifolds, and we relate bipartiteness of the xyz graph to
orientability of the underlying topological surface. Using this correspondence,
we show that planar graphs are xyz graphs if and only if they are bipartite,
cubic, and three-connected, and that it is NP-complete to determine whether an
arbitrary graph is an xyz graph. We also describe an algorithm with running
time O(n 2^{n/2}) for testing whether a given graph is an xyz graph.

Let Sigma denote the state space, -&gt; the transition relation and Psim the
partition of Sigma induced by simulation equivalence. The algorithms by
Henzinger, Henzinger, Kopke and by Bloom and Paige run in O(|Sigma||-&gt;|)-time
and, as far as time-complexity is concerned, they are the best available
algorithms. However, these algorithms have the drawback of a space complexity
that is more than quadratic in the size of the state space. The algorithm by
Gentilini, Piazza, Policriti--subsequently corrected by van Glabbeek and
Ploeger--appears to provide the best compromise between time and space
complexity. Gentilini et al.'s algorithm runs in O(|Psim|^2|-&gt;|)-time while the
space complexity is in O(|Psim|^2 + |Sigma|log|Psim|). We present here a new
efficient simulation algorithm that is obtained as a modification of Henzinger
et al.'s algorithm and whose correctness is based on some techniques used in
applications of abstract interpretation to model checking. Our algorithm runs
in O(|Psim||-&gt;|)-time and O(|Psim||Sigma|log|Sigma|)-space. Thus, this
algorithm improves the best known time bound while retaining an acceptable
space complexity that is in general less than quadratic in the size of the
state space. An experimental evaluation showed good comparative results with
respect to Henzinger, Henzinger and Kopke's algorithm.

with periodic returns on investment. In our approach, we consider an investment
model where the agent decides at every time step the proportion of wealth to
invest in a risky asset, keeping the rest of the budget in a risk-free asset.
Every investment is evaluated in the market via a stylized return on investment
function (RoI), which is modeled by a stochastic process with unknown
periodicities and levels of noise. For comparison reasons, we present two
reference strategies which represent the case of agents with zero-knowledge and
complete-knowledge of the dynamics of the returns. We consider also an
investment strategy based on technical analysis to forecast the next return by
fitting a trend line to previous received returns. To account for the
performance of the different strategies, we perform some computer experiments
to calculate the average budget that can be obtained with them over a certain
number of time steps. To assure for fair comparisons, we first tune the
parameters of each strategy. Afterwards, we compare the performance of these
strategies for RoIs with different periodicities and levels of noise.

on the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, by
constructing a serially concatenated code consisting of two systematic
irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) component codes connected by an interleaver.
The interleaver is designed to prevent stopping-set error events in one of the
IRA codes from propagating into stopping set events of the other code.
Simulations with two 128-bit rate 0.707 IRA component codes show that the
proposed architecture achieves a much lower error floor at higher SNRs,
compared to a 16384-bit rate 1/2 IRA code, but incurs an SNR penalty of about 2
dB at low to medium SNRs. Experiments indicate that the SNR penalty can be
reduced at larger blocklengths.

systems has been extensively studied from both communication-theoretic and
information-theoretic perspectives. Most of these papers assume
perfect/imperfect channel knowledge. In general, the problem of channel
training and estimation is studied separately. However, in interference-limited
communication systems with high mobility, this problem is tightly coupled with
the problem of maximizing throughput of the system. In this paper, scheduling
and pre-conditioning based schemes in the presence of reciprocal channel are
considered to address this. In the case of homogeneous users, a scheduling
scheme is proposed and an improved lower bound on the sum capacity is derived.
The problem of choosing training sequence length to maximize net throughput of
the system is studied. In the case of heterogeneous users, a modified
pre-conditioning method is proposed and an optimized pre-conditioning matrix is
derived. This method is combined with a scheduling scheme to further improve
net achievable weighted-sum rate.

simulation on the grid, with and without specialized (GRAPE-6) hardware. Our
inter-continental virtual organization consists of three sites, one in Tokyo,
one in Philadelphia and one in Amsterdam. We run simulations with up to 196608
particles for a variety of topologies. In many cases, high performance
simulations over the entire planet are dominated by network bandwidth rather
than latency. With this global grid of GRAPEs our calculation time remains
dominated by communication over the entire range of N, which was limited due to
the use of three sites. Increasing the number of particles will result in a
more efficient execution. Based on these timings we construct and calibrate a
model to predict the performance of our simulation on any grid infrastructure
with or without GRAPE. We apply this model to predict the simulation
performance on the Netherlands DAS-3 wide area computer. Equipping the DAS-3
with GRAPE-6Af hardware would achieve break-even between calculation and
communication at a few million particles, resulting in a compute time of just
over ten hours for 1 N -body time unit. Key words: high-performance computing,
grid, N-body simulation, performance modelling

practically solves this problem on small processors that are often found in
embedded systems. The algorithm does not require special CPU instructions (such

suffer the ABA problem associated with swing pointers. The algorithm gives
&quot;first-in, almost first-out&quot; guarantees under pathological interrupt

dynamical systems theory, has been essentially studied in dimension 1. This
paper focuses on 2D CA and aims at showing that the situation is different and
more complex. The main results are the existence of non sensitive CA without
equicontinuous points, the non-recursivity of sensitivity constants and the
existence of CA having only non-recursive equicontinuous points. They all show
a difference between the 1D and the 2D case. Thanks to these new constructions,
we also extend undecidability results concerning topological classification
previously obtained in the 1D case.

similarity is based on a distance. Symbolic representation of time series has
attracted many researchers recently, since it reduces the dimensionality of
these high dimensional data objects. We propose a new distance metric that is
applied to symbolic data objects and we test it on time series data bases in a
classification task. We compare it to other distances that are well known in
the literature for symbolic data objects. We also prove, mathematically, that
our distance is metric.

  with Confidential Messages</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</comments><abstract>  In wireless data networks, communication is particularly susceptible to
eavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. Security and privacy systems have
become critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper
considers the problem of secret communication over the Gaussian broadcast
channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential
messages to two users with information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each user
would like to obtain its own confidential message in a reliable and safe
manner. This communication model is referred to as the multi-antenna Gaussian
broadcast channel with confidential messages (MGBC-CM). Under this
communication scenario, a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and the
corresponding achievable secrecy rate region are first developed based on
Gaussian codebooks. Next, a computable Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy
capacity region is provided for the MGBC-CM. Furthermore, the Sato-type outer
bound prove to be consistent with the boundary of the secret dirty-paper coding
achievable rate region, and hence, the secrecy capacity region of the MGBC-CM
is established. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate that both users can
achieve positive rates simultaneously under the information-theoretic secrecy
requirement.

equipped with an evolutionarily selected learning ability. Such a coupling of
biological and linguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a
small change of a model control parameter a poorly communicating group of
linguistically unskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating
group with large learning abilities. When learning ability is kept fixed, the
transition appears to be continuous. Genetic imprinting of the learning
abilities proceeds via Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents
learn a language and that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary
pressure for the increase of learning ability.Our model suggests that when
linguistic (or cultural) processes became intensive enough, a transition took
place where both linguistic performance and biological endowment of our species
experienced an abrupt change that perhaps triggered the rapid expansion of
human civilization.

  control and computing, to appear in proceedings</comments><abstract>  We develop a general framework for MAP estimation in discrete and Gaussian
graphical models using Lagrangian relaxation techniques. The key idea is to
reformulate an intractable estimation problem as one defined on a more
tractable graph, but subject to additional constraints. Relaxing these
constraints gives a tractable dual problem, one defined by a thin graph, which
is then optimized by an iterative procedure. When this iterative optimization
leads to a consistent estimate, one which also satisfies the constraints, then
it corresponds to an optimal MAP estimate of the original model. Otherwise
there is a ``duality gap'', and we obtain a bound on the optimal solution.
Thus, our approach combines convex optimization with dynamic programming
techniques applicable for thin graphs. The popular tree-reweighted max-product
(TRMP) method may be seen as solving a particular class of such relaxations,
where the intractable graph is relaxed to a set of spanning trees. We also
consider relaxations to a set of small induced subgraphs, thin subgraphs (e.g.
loops), and a connected tree obtained by ``unwinding'' cycles. In addition, we
propose a new class of multiscale relaxations that introduce ``summary''
variables. The potential benefits of such generalizations include: reducing or
eliminating the ``duality gap'' in hard problems, reducing the number or
Lagrange multipliers in the dual problem, and accelerating convergence of the
iterative optimization procedure.

over a given area, a probability model for the network lifetime is provided.
Using this model and assuming that packet generation follows a Poisson
distribution, an analytical expression for the complementary cumulative density
function (ccdf) of the lifetime is obtained. Using this ccdf, one can
accurately find the probability that the network achieves a given lifetime. It
is also shown that when the number of sensors, $N$, is large, with an error
exponentially decaying with $N$, one can predict whether or not a certain
lifetime can be achieved. The results of this work are obtained for both
multi-hop and single-hop wireless sensor networks and are verified with
computer simulation. The approaches of this paper are shown to be applicable to
other packet generation models and the effect of the area shape is also
investigated.

time method for performing near-isometric point pattern matching by means of
exact probabilistic inference in a chordal graphical model. Their fundamental
result is that the chordal graph in question is shown to be globally rigid,
implying that exact inference provides the same matching solution as exact
inference in a complete graphical model. This implies that the algorithm is
optimal when there is no noise in the point patterns. In this paper, we present
a new graph which is also globally rigid but has an advantage over the graph
proposed in \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06}: its maximal clique size is smaller,
rendering inference significantly more efficient. However, our graph is not
chordal and thus standard Junction Tree algorithms cannot be directly applied.
Nevertheless, we show that loopy belief propagation in such a graph converges
to the optimal solution. This allows us to retain the optimality guarantee in
the noiseless case, while substantially reducing both memory requirements and
processing time. Our experimental results show that the accuracy of the
proposed solution is indistinguishable from that of \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06} when
there is noise in the point patterns.

the unit-cost comparison model. This work is the first treatment of a natural
stochastic variant of the problem where the cost of comparing two elements is a
random variable. Each cost is chosen independently and is known to the
algorithm. In particular we consider the following three models: each cost is
chosen uniformly in the range $[0,1]$, each cost is 0 with some probability $p$
and 1 otherwise, or each cost is 1 with probability $p$ and infinite otherwise.
We present lower and upper bounds (optimal in most cases) for these problems.
We obtain our upper bounds by carefully designing algorithms to ensure that the
costs incurred at various stages are independent and using properties of random
partial orders when appropriate.

nomadic transmitter with several antennas, which is received by multiple
agents, exhibiting independent channel gains and additive circular-symmetric
complex Gaussian noise. In the nomadic regime, we assume that the agents do not
have any decoding ability. These agents process their channel observations and
forward them to the final destination through lossless links with a fixed
capacity. We propose new achievable rates based on elementary compression and
also on a Wyner-Ziv (CEO-like) processing, for both fast fading and block
fading channels, as well as for general discrete channels. The simpler two
agents scheme is solved, up to an implicit equation with a single variable.
Limiting the nomadic transmitter to a circular-symmetric complex Gaussian
signalling, new upper bounds are derived for both fast and block fading, based
on the vector version of the entropy power inequality. These bounds are then
compared to the achievable rates in several extreme scenarios. The asymptotic
setting with numbers of agents and transmitter's antennas taken to infinity is
analyzed. In addition, the upper bounds are analytically shown to be tight in
several examples, while numerical calculations reveal a rather small gap in a
finite $2\times2$ setting. The advantage of the Wyner-Ziv approach over
elementary compression is shown where only the former can achieve the full
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. We also consider the non-nomadic setting, with
agents that can decode. Here we give an achievable rate, over fast fading
channel, which combines broadcast with dirty paper coding and the decentralized
reception, which was introduced for the nomadic setting.

that has successfully resisted cryptanalysis for thirty years. The original
version, based on Goppa codes, is able to guarantee a high level of security,
and is faster than competing solutions, like RSA. Despite this, it has been
rarely considered in practical applications, due to two major drawbacks: i)
large size of the public key and ii) low transmission rate. Low-Density
Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are state-of-art forward error correcting codes that
permit to approach the Shannon limit while ensuring limited complexity.
Quasi-Cyclic (QC) LDPC codes are a particular class of LDPC codes, able to join
low complexity encoding of QC codes with high-performing and low-complexity
decoding of LDPC codes. In a previous work it has been proposed to adopt a
particular family of QC-LDPC codes in the McEliece cryptosystem to reduce the
key size and increase the transmission rate. Recently, however, new attacks
have been found that are able to exploit a flaw in the transformation from the
private key to the public one. Such attacks can be effectively countered by
changing the form of some constituent matrices, without altering the system
parameters. This work gives an overview of the QC-LDPC codes-based McEliece
cryptosystem and its cryptanalysis. Two recent versions are considered, and
their ability to counter all the currently known attacks is discussed. A third
version able to reach a higher security level is also proposed. Finally, it is
shown that the new QC-LDPC codes-based cryptosystem scales favorably with the
key length.

Propagation algorithm with decimation over factor graphs of Low Density
Generator Matrix (LDGM) codes. This algorithm, which we call Bias Propagation
(BiP), can be considered as a special case of the Survey Propagation algorithm
proposed for binary quantization by Wainwright et al. [8]. It achieves the same
near-optimal rate-distortion performance with a substantially simpler framework
and 10-100 times faster implementation. We thus challenge the widespread belief
that binary quantization based on sparse linear codes cannot be solved by
simple Belief Propagation algorithms. Finally, we give examples of suitably
irregular LDGM codes that work with the BiP algorithm and show their
performance.

arbitrary set of words is rather relevant in itself, for instance, in the
aspect of development of means for internet-content indexing or separating
signals and noise in communication channels. The Zipf law is currently
considered to be the most reliable criterion of this kind [3]. At any rate,
conventional stochastic word sets do not meet this law. The present paper deals
with one of possible criteria based on the determination of the degree of data

formal conformity of a document given by the retrieval system to user's
information query. As a rule, the documents found by the retrieval system
should be submitted to the user in a certain order. Therefore, a retrieval
perceived as a selection of documents formally solving the user's query, should
be supplemented with a certain procedure of processing a relevant set. It would
be natural to introduce a quantitative measure of document conformity to query,
i.e. the relevance measure. Since no single rule exists for the determination
of the relevance measure, we shall consider two of them which are the simplest
in our opinion. The proposed approach does not suppose any restrictions and can
be applied to other relevance measures.

algorithms for image inpainting. Unlike traditional gradient-based approaches,
which may require many iterations to converge, our techniques achieve
competitive results after only a few iterations. On the other hand, while
belief-propagation techniques are often unable to deal with high-order models
due to the explosion in the size of messages, we avoid this problem by
approximating our high-order prior model using a Gaussian mixture. By using
such an approximation, we are able to inpaint images quickly while at the same
time retaining good visual results.

Architectural and Satellite Communications' as a theoretical approach of an
invention-model to 'store time-data'. The current release entails three
concepts: 1- an in-depth theoretical physics engineering of the chip including
its, 2- architectural concept based on VLSI methods, and 3- the time-data
versus data-time algorithm. The 'Parallel Time Varying &amp; Data Super-helical
Access Memory' (PTVD-SHAM), possesses a waterfall effect in its architecture
dealing with the process of voltage output-switch into diverse logic and
quantum states described as 'Boolean logic &amp; image-logic', respectively.
Quantum dot computational methods are explained by utilizing coiled carbon
nanotubes (CCNTs) and CNT field effect transistors (CNFETs) in the chip's
architecture. Quantum confinement, categorized quantum well substrate, and
B-field flux involvements are discussed in theory. Multi-access of coherent
sequences of 'qubit addressing' in any magnitude, gained as pre-defined, here
e.g., the 'big O notation' asymptotically confined into singularity while
possessing a magnitude of 'infinity' for the orientation of array displacement.
Gaussian curvature of k&lt;0 versus k'&gt;(k&lt;0) is debated in aim of specifying the
2D electron gas characteristics, data storage system for defining short and
long time cycles for different CCNT diameters where space-time continuum is
folded by chance for the particle. Precise pre/post data timing for, e.g.,
seismic waves before earthquake mantle-reach event occurrence, including time
varying self-clocking devices in diverse geographic locations for radar systems
is illustrated in the Subsections of the paper. The theoretical fabrication
process, electromigration between chip's components is discussed as well.

churn) in structured peer-to-peer networks. We use a fluid model approach to
describe steady-state or transient phenomena, and apply it to the Chord system.
For any rate of churn and stabilization rates, and any system size, we
accurately account for the functional form of the probability of network
disconnection as well as the fraction of failed or incorrect successor and
finger pointers. We show how we can use these quantities to predict both the
performance and consistency of lookups under churn. All theoretical predictions
match simulation results. The analysis includes both features that are generic
to structured overlays deploying a ring as well as Chord-specific details, and
opens the door to a systematic comparative analysis of, at least, ring-based
structured overlay systems under churn.

wideband slow-fading channel, modeled as an (asymptotically) large number of
independent identically distributed parallel channels, with the random channel
fading realizations remaining constant over the entire coding block. On the one
hand, in the wideband limit the minimum achievable energy per nat required for
reliable transmission, as a random variable, converges in probability to
certain deterministic quantity. On the other hand, the exponential decay rate
of the outage probability, termed as the wideband outage exponent,
characterizes how the number of parallel channels, {\it i.e.}, the
``bandwidth'', should asymptotically scale in order to achieve a targeted
outage probability at a targeted energy per nat. We examine two scenarios: when
the transmitter has no channel state information and adopts uniform transmit
power allocation among parallel channels; and when the transmitter is endowed
with an one-bit channel state feedback for each parallel channel and
accordingly allocates its transmit power. For both scenarios, we evaluate the
wideband minimum energy per nat and the wideband outage exponent, and discuss
their implication for system performance.

  one good enough?</title><categories>cs.DS cs.CC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The Metric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical NP-hard
optimization problem. The double-tree shortcutting method for Metric TSP yields
an exponentially-sized space of TSP tours, each of which approximates the
optimal solution within at most a factor of 2. We consider the problem of
finding among these tours the one that gives the closest approximation, i.e.\
the \emph{minimum-weight double-tree shortcutting}. Burkard et al. gave an
algorithm for this problem, running in time $O(n^3+2^d n^2)$ and memory $O(2^d
n^2)$, where $d$ is the maximum node degree in the rooted minimum spanning
tree. We give an improved algorithm for the case of small $d$ (including planar
Euclidean TSP, where $d \leq 4$), running in time $O(4^d n^2)$ and memory
$O(4^d n)$. This improvement allows one to solve the problem on much larger
instances than previously attempted. Our computational experiments suggest that
in terms of the time-quality tradeoff, the minimum-weight double-tree
shortcutting method provides one of the best known tour-constructing
heuristics.

rational points by a polynomial-time boolean algorithm, does it have a
polynomial-size arithmetic circuit? We argue that this question is certainly
difficult. Answering it negatively would indeed imply that the constant-free
versions of the algebraic complexity classes VP and VNP defined by Valiant are
different. Answering this question positively would imply a transfer theorem
from boolean to algebraic complexity. Our proof method relies on Lagrange
interpolation and on recent results connecting the (boolean) counting hierarchy
to algebraic complexity classes. As a byproduct we obtain two additional
results: (i) The constant-free, degree-unbounded version of Valiant's
hypothesis that VP and VNP differ implies the degree-bounded version. This
result was previously known to hold for fields of positive characteristic only.
(ii) If exponential sums of easy to compute polynomials can be computed
efficiently, then the same is true of exponential products. We point out an
application of this result to the P=NP problem in the Blum-Shub-Smale model of
computation over the field of complex numbers.

Report TR-2007-01, Swedish Institute of Computer Science</report-no><abstract>  In this paper, we present an analytical tool for understanding the
performance of structured overlay networks under churn based on the
master-equation approach of physics. We motivate and derive an equation for the
average number of hops taken by lookups during churn, for the Chord network. We
analyse this equation in detail to understand the behaviour with and without
churn. We then use this understanding to predict how lookups will scale for
varying peer population as well as varying the sizes of the routing tables. We
then consider a change in the maintenance algorithm of the overlay, from
periodic stabilisation to a reactive one which corrects fingers only when a
change is detected. We generalise our earlier analysis to underdstand how the
reactive strategy compares with the periodic one.

and memory cards I/O's, is investigated for the phenomenon by propounding a
unified theory of Einstein's two known relativities. It is conclusive that
flies could contribute a certain amount of neuromatrices indicating an imagery
function of a visual-computational system into computer graphics and storage
systems. The visual system involves the time aspect, whereas flies possess
faster pulses compared to humans' visual ability due to the E-field state on an
active fly's eye surface. This behaviour can be tested on a dissected fly
specimen at its ommatidia. Electro-optical contacts and electrodes are wired
through the flesh forming organic emitter layer to stimulate light emission,
thereby to a computer circuit. The next step is applying a threshold voltage
with secondary voltages to the circuit denoting an array of essential
electrodes for bit switch. As a result, circuit's dormant pulses versus active
pulses at the specimen's area are recorded. The outcome matrix possesses a
construction of RGB and time radicals expressing the time problem in
consumption, allocating time into computational algorithms, enhancing the
technology far beyond. The obtained formulation generates consumed distance
cons(x), denoting circuital travel between data source/sink for pixel data and
bendable wavelengths. Once 'image logic' is in place, incorporating this point
of graphical acceleration permits one to enhance graphics and optimize
immensely central processing, data transmissions between memory and computer
visual system. The phenomenon can be mainly used in 360-deg. display/viewing,
3D scanning techniques, military and medicine, a robust and cheap substitution
for e.g. pre-motion pattern analysis, real-time rendering and LCDs.

Its design was motivated by
distributed video coding where, for decoding, error correction methods are
applied to improve predictions. Those error corrections sometimes fail which
results in decoded values worse than the initial prediction. Our code exploits
the fact that bit errors are relatively unlikely events: more than a few bit
errors in a decoded pixel value are rare. With a carefully designed counting
code combined with a prediction those bit errors can be corrected and sometimes
the original pixel value recovered. The error correction improves
significantly. Our new code not only maximizes the Hamming distance between
adjacent (or &quot;near 1&quot;) codewords but also between nearby (for example &quot;near 2&quot;)
codewords. This is why our code is significantly different from the well-known
maximal counting sequences which have maximal average Hamming distance.
Fortunately, the new counting code can be derived from Gray Codes for every
code word length (i.e. bit depth).

is an integer larger than the field characteristic. With some control on the

arithmetic directly with machine integers or floating points. Depending also on
the number of performed numerical operations one can then convert back to the
$q$-adic or $X$-adic representation and eventually mod out high residues. In
this note we present a new version of both conversions: more tabulations and a
way to reduce the number of divisions involved in the process are presented.
The polynomial multiplication is then applied to arithmetic in small finite
field extensions.

linearity information are widely used. Devising abstract unification algorithms
for such domains has proved to be rather hard. At the moment, the available
algorithms are correct but not optimal, i.e., they cannot fully exploit the
information conveyed by the abstract domains. In this paper, we define a new
(infinite) domain ShLin-w which can be thought of as a general framework from
which other domains can be easily derived by abstraction. ShLin-w makes the
interaction between sharing and linearity explicit. We provide a constructive
characterization of the optimal abstract unification operator on ShLin-w and we
lift it to two well-known abstractions of ShLin-w. Namely, to the classical
Sharing X Lin abstract domain and to the more precise ShLin-2 abstract domain
by Andy King. In the case of single binding substitutions, we obtain optimal
abstract unification algorithms for such domains.

  Asymptotic and Finite Analysis, and Thresholds</title><categories>cs.DM cs.IT cs.NI math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to IEEE transactions on information theory (Submission date
  October 1, 2007)</comments><abstract>  We derive the probability that a randomly chosen NL-node over $S$ gets
localized as a function of a variety of parameters. Then, we derive the
probability that the whole network of NL-nodes over $S$ gets localized. In
connection with the asymptotic thresholds, we show the presence of asymptotic
thresholds on the network localization probability in two different scenarios.
The first refers to dense networks, which arise when the domain $S$ is bounded
and the densities of the two kinds of nodes tend to grow unboundedly. The
second kind of thresholds manifest themselves when the considered domain
increases but the number of nodes grow in such a way that the L-node density
remains constant throughout the investigated domain. In this scenario, what
matters is the minimum value of the maximum transmission range averaged over
the fading process, denoted as $d_{max}$, above which the network of NL-nodes
almost surely gets asymptotically localized.

open-ended zones with nine lengthwise boundaries. In each zone, a
minimum-length Hamiltonian Path (HP) is found for each combination of boundary
vertices, leading to an approximation for the minimum-length Hamiltonian Cycle
(HC). Determination of the optimal HPs for subsequent zones has the effect of
automatically filtering out non-optimal HPs from earlier zones. Although the
optimal HC for ATT48 involves only two crossing edges between all zones (with
one exception), adding inter-zone edges can accommodate more complex problems.

In a state
estimate, we are given observations distributed according to an unknown
distribution $P_{\theta}$ (associated with award $Q$), which Nature chooses at
random from the set $\{P_{\theta}: \theta \in \Theta \}$ according to a known
prior distribution $\mu$ on $\Theta$, we produce an estimate $M$ for the
unknown distribution $P_{\theta}$, and in the end, we will suffer a relative
entropy cost $\mathcal{R}(P;M)$, measuring the quality of this estimate,
therefore the whole utility is taken as $P \cdot Q -\mathcal{R}(P; M)$.
  In an introduction to strategic game, a sufficient condition for minimax
theorem is obtained; An estimate is explored in the frame of game theory, and
in the view of convex conjugate, we reach one new approach to quantum relative
entropy, correspondingly quantum mutual entropy, and quantum channel capacity,
which are more general, in the sense, without Radon-Nikodym (RN) derivatives.
Also the monotonicity of quantum relative entropy and the additivity of quantum
channel capacity are investigated.

Markov random fields. It has been recently derived by Dror Weitz and used to
construct the first fully polynomial approximation scheme for counting
independent sets up to the `tree uniqueness threshold.' It can be regarded as a
clever method for pruning the belief propagation computation tree, in such a
way to exactly account for the effect of loops.
  In this paper we generalize the original algorithm to make it suitable for
decoding linear codes, and discuss various schemes for pruning the computation
tree. Further, we present the outcomes of numerical simulations on several
linear codes, showing that tree pruning allows to interpolate continuously
between belief propagation and maximum a posteriori decoding. Finally, we
discuss theoretical implications of the new method.

Allerton conference</comments><abstract>  Measuring network flow sizes is important for tasks like accounting/billing,
network forensics and security. Per-flow accounting is considered hard because
it requires that many counters be updated at a very high speed; however, the
large fast memories needed for storing the counters are prohibitively
expensive. Therefore, current approaches aim to obtain approximate flow counts;
that is, to detect large elephant flows and then measure their sizes.
  Recently the authors and their collaborators have developed [1] a novel
method for per-flow traffic measurement that is fast, highly memory efficient
and accurate. At the core of this method is a novel counter architecture called
&quot;counter braids.'' In this paper, we analyze the performance of the counter
braid architecture under a Maximum Likelihood (ML) flow size estimation
algorithm and show that it is optimal; that is, the number of bits needed to
store the size of a flow matches the entropy lower bound. While the ML
algorithm is optimal, it is too complex to implement. In [1] we have developed
an easy-to-implement and efficient message passing algorithm for estimating
flow sizes.

analysis of self-assembly systems from a computational perspective, that is,
from the perspective of mathematical problems whose study may give insight into
the natural processes through which elementary objects self-assemble into more
complex ones. One of the main problems of algorithmic self-assembly is the
minimum tile set problem (MTSP), which asks for a collection of types of
elementary objects (called tiles) to be found for the self-assembly of an
object having a pre-established shape. Such a collection is to be as concise as
possible, thus minimizing supply diversity, while satisfying a set of stringent
constraints having to do with the termination and other properties of the
self-assembly process from its tile types. We present a study of what we think
is the first practical approach to MTSP. Our study starts with the introduction
of an evolutionary heuristic to tackle MTSP and includes results from extensive
experimentation with the heuristic on the self-assembly of simple objects in
two and three dimensions. The heuristic we introduce combines classic elements
from the field of evolutionary computation with a problem-specific variant of
Pareto dominance into a multi-objective approach to MTSP.

pair of which is connected by an edge in E. The clique problem is an
optimization problem of finding a clique of maximum size in graph. The clique
problem is NP-Complete. We have succeeded in developing a fast algorithm for
maximum clique problem by employing the method of verification and elimination.
For a graph of size N there are 2N sub graphs, which may be cliques and hence
verifying all of them, will take a long time. Idea is to eliminate a major
number of sub graphs, which cannot be cliques and verifying only the remaining
sub graphs. This heuristic algorithm runs in polynomial time and executes
successfully for several examples when applied to random graphs and DIMACS
benchmark graphs.

(WLAN) enjoys unique advantages in providing high-speed and low-cost wireless
services in hot spots and indoor environments. Traditional WLAN
medium-access-control (MAC) protocols assume that only one station can transmit
at a time: simultaneous transmissions of more than one station causes the
destruction of all packets involved. By exploiting recent advances in PHY-layer
multiuser detection (MUD) techniques, it is possible for a receiver to receive
multiple packets simultaneously. This paper argues that such multipacket
reception (MPR) capability can greatly enhance the capacity of future WLANs. In
addition, it provides the MAC-layer and PHY-layer designs needed to achieve the
improved capacity. First, to demonstrate MUD/MPR as a powerful
capacity-enhancement technique, we prove a &quot;super-linearity&quot; result, which
states that the system throughput per unit cost increases as the MPR capability
increases. Second, we show that the commonly deployed binary exponential
backoff (BEB) algorithm in today's WLAN MAC may not be optimal in an MPR
system, and that the optimal backoff factor increases with the MPR capability:
the number of packets that can be received simultaneously. Third, based on the
above insights, we design a joint MAC-PHY layer protocol for an IEEE
802.11-like WLAN that incorporates advanced PHY-layer blind detection and MUD
techniques to implement MPR

In particular, we show that a random formula of density 4.453 or higher almost
surely has no non-trivial &quot;core&quot; assignments. Core assignments are certain
partial assignments that can be extended to satisfying assignments, and have
been studied recently in connection with the Survey Propagation heuristic for
random SAT. Their existence implies the presence of clusters of solutions, and
they have been shown to exist with high probability below the satisfiability
threshold for k-SAT with k&gt;8, by Achlioptas and Ricci-Tersenghi, STOC 2006. Our
result implies that either this does not hold for 3-SAT or the threshold
density for satisfiability in 3-SAT lies below 4.453.
  The main technical tool that we use is a novel simple application of the
first moment method.

Final version to appear in Theory of Computing Systems</comments><acm-class>F.3.3; F.1.3</acm-class><abstract>  The authors' ATR programming formalism is a version of call-by-value PCF
under a complexity-theoretically motivated type system. ATR programs run in
type-2 polynomial-time and all standard type-2 basic feasible functionals are
ATR-definable (ATR types are confined to levels 0, 1, and 2). A limitation of
the original version of ATR is that the only directly expressible recursions
are tail-recursions. Here we extend ATR so that a broad range of affine
recursions are directly expressible. In particular, the revised ATR can fairly
naturally express the classic insertion- and selection-sort algorithms, thus
overcoming a sticking point of most prior implicit-complexity-based formalisms.
The paper's main work is in refining the original time-complexity semantics for
ATR to show that these new recursion schemes do not lead out of the realm of
feasibility.

interpretation of those cues. We show the different data flows between this

captured by the system for being able to recognize the human emotions.

contribution of voice system messages to visual search efficiency and comfort.
Messages which include spatial information on the target location are meant to
support search for familiar targets in collections of photographs (30 per
display). 24 participants carried out 240 visual search tasks in two conditions
differing from each other in initial target presentation only. The isolated
target was presented either simultaneously with an oral message (multimodal
presentation, MP), or without any message (visual presentation, VP). Averaged
target selection times were thrice longer and errors almost twice more frequent
in the VP condition than in the MP condition. In addition, the contribution of
spatial messages to visual search rapidity and accuracy was influenced by
display layout and task difficulty. Most results are statistically significant.
Besides, subjective judgments indicate that oral messages were well accepted.

  on Communication, Control and Computing, Monticello, IL, September 26 - 28,
  2007</comments><abstract>  In this work, the role of noisy feedback in enhancing the secrecy capacity of
the wiretap channel is investigated. A model is considered in which the
feed-forward and feedback signals share the same noisy channel. More
specifically, a discrete memoryless modulo-additive channel with a full-duplex
destination node is considered first, and it is shown that a judicious use of
feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity to the capacity of the
source-destination channel in the absence of the wiretapper. In the
achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a private key, known
only to the destination. Then a half-duplex system is considered, for which a
novel feedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate
(even when the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the
source-destination channel) is proposed. These results hinge on the
modulo-additive property of the channel, which is exploited by the destination
to perform encryption over the channel without revealing its key to the source.

This coding scheme is in the form of a block Markov code. The transmitter uses
a superposition Markov code. The relay compresses the received signal and maps
the compressed version of the received signal into a codeword conditioned on
the codeword of the previous block. The receiver performs joint decoding after
it has received all of the B blocks. We show that this coding scheme can be
viewed as a generalization of the well-known Compress-And-Forward (CAF) scheme
proposed by Cover and El Gamal. Our coding scheme provides options for
preserving the correlation between the channel inputs of the transmitter and
the relay, which is not possible in the CAF scheme. Thus, our proposed scheme
may potentially yield a larger achievable rate than the CAF scheme.

number of randomly deployed sensors making a network connected with a given
probability. In practice sensors are often deployed one by one along a
trajectory of a vehicle, so it is natural to assume that arbitrary probability
density functions of distances between successive sensors in a segment are
given. The paper computes the probability of connectivity and coverage of
1-dimensional networks and gives estimates for a minimal number of sensors for
important distributions.

partitioned into two subsets $X$ and $Y$ such that the punctured code of ${\cal
C}$ by deleting the coordinates outside $X$ (respectively, $Y$) is a binary
linear code (respectively, a quaternary linear code). In this paper
$\Z_2\Z_4$-additive codes are studied. Their corresponding binary images, via
the Gray map, are $\Z_2\Z_4$-linear codes, which seem to be a very
distinguished class of binary group codes.
  As for binary and quaternary linear codes, for these codes the fundamental
parameters are found and standard forms for generator and parity check matrices
are given. For this, the appropriate inner product is deduced and the concept
of duality for $\Z_2\Z_4$-additive codes is defined. Moreover, the parameters
of the dual codes are computed. Finally, some conditions for self-duality of
$\Z_2\Z_4$-additive codes are given.

(DLAL) as a variant of Light linear logic suitable for guaranteeing complexity
properties on lambda calculus terms: all typable terms can be evaluated in
polynomial time by beta reduction and all Ptime functions can be represented.
In the present work we address the problem of typing lambda-terms in
second-order DLAL. For that we give a procedure which, starting with a term
typed in system F, determines whether it is typable in DLAL and outputs a
concrete typing if there exists any. We show that our procedure can be run in
time polynomial in the size of the original Church typed system F term.

codes with iterative decoding for the block-fading channel. We first study the
case of maximum-likelihood decoding, and show that the design criterion is
rather straightforward. Unfortunately, optimal constructions for
maximum-likelihood decoding do not perform well under iterative decoding. To
overcome this limitation, we then introduce a new family of full-diversity LDPC
codes that exhibit near-outage-limit performance under iterative decoding for
all block-lengths. This family competes with multiplexed parallel turbo codes
suitable for nonergodic channels and recently reported in the literature.

  Wireless Channels</title><categories>cs.NI cs.MA</categories><comments>14 pages, 14 figures</comments><abstract>  In this paper, we consider the problem of power efficient uplink scheduling
in a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system over a fading wireless
channel. The objective is to minimize the power expenditure of each user
subject to satisfying individual user delay. We make the practical assumption
that the system statistics are unknown, i.e., the probability distributions of
the user arrivals and channel states are unknown. The problem has the structure
of a Constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP). Determining an optimal policy
under for the CMDP faces the problems of state space explosion and unknown
system statistics. To tackle the problem of state space explosion, we suggest
determining the transmission rate of a particular user in each slot based on
its channel condition and buffer occupancy only. The rate allocation algorithm
for a particular user is a learning algorithm that learns about the buffer
occupancy and channel states of that user during system execution and thus
addresses the issue of unknown system statistics. Once the rate of each user is
determined, the proposed algorithm schedules the user with the best rate. Our
simulations within an IEEE 802.16 system demonstrate that the algorithm is
indeed able to satisfy the user specified delay constraints. We compare the
performance of our algorithm with the well known M-LWDF algorithm. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the power expended by the users under our algorithm is quite
low.

  Springer-Verlag</comments><proxy>ccsd hal-00177059</proxy><report-no>2007-58</report-no><abstract>  Techniques for data-mining, latent semantic analysis, contextual search of
databases, etc. have long ago been developed by computer scientists working on
information retrieval (IR). Experimental scientists, from all disciplines,
having to analyse large collections of raw experimental data (astronomical,
physical, biological, etc.) have developed powerful methods for their
statistical analysis and for clustering, categorising, and classifying objects.
Finally, physicists have developed a theory of quantum measurement, unifying
the logical, algebraic, and probabilistic aspects of queries into a single
formalism. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first to show that when
formulated at an abstract level, problems from IR, from statistical data
analysis, and from physical measurement theories are very similar and hence can
profitably be cross-fertilised, and, secondly, to propose a novel method of
fuzzy hierarchical clustering, termed \textit{semantic distillation} --
strongly inspired from the theory of quantum measurement --, we developed to
analyse raw data coming from various types of experiments on DNA arrays. We
illustrate the method by analysing DNA arrays experiments and clustering the
genes of the array according to their specificity.

specifications and models. In this paper we improve the description of the
inference process, which is seen as a Yoneda functor on a bicategory of
fractions. A diagrammatic logic is defined from a morphism of limit sketches
(called a propagator) which gives rise to an adjunction, which in turn
determines a bicategory of fractions. The propagator, the adjunction and the
bicategory provide respectively the syntax, the models and the inference
process for the logic. Then diagrammatic logics and their morphisms are applied
to the semantics of side effects in computer languages.

information lattices, first proposed by Shannon. Exploiting this formalization,
we identify a comprehensive parallelism between information lattices and
subgroup lattices. Qualitatively, we demonstrate isomorphisms between
information lattices and subgroup lattices. Quantitatively, we establish a
decisive approximation relation between the entropy structures of information
lattices and the log-index structures of the corresponding subgroup lattices.
This approximation extends the approximation for joint entropies carried out
previously by Chan and Yeung. As a consequence of our approximation result, we
show that any continuous law holds in general for the entropies of information
elements if and only if the same law holds in general for the log-indices of
subgroups. As an application, by constructing subgroup counterexamples we find
surprisingly that common information, unlike joint information, obeys neither
the submodularity nor the supermodularity law. We emphasize that the notion of
information elements is conceptually significant--formalizing it helps to
reveal the deep connection between information theory and group theory. The
parallelism established in this paper admits an appealing group-action
explanation and provides useful insights into the intrinsic structure among
information elements from a group-theoretic perspective.

In the differential
setting, it is shown that weak convergence of probability measures, or
convergence in distribution, is not enough for convergence of the associated
differential entropies. A general result for the desired differential entropy
convergence is provided, taking into account both compactly and uncompactly
supported densities. Convergence of differential entropy is also characterized
in terms of the Kullback-Liebler discriminant for densities with fairly general
supports, and it is shown that convergence in variation of probability measures
guarantees such convergence under an appropriate boundedness condition on the
densities involved. Results for the discrete setting are also provided,
allowing for infinitely supported probability measures, by taking advantage of
the equivalence between weak convergence and convergence in variation in this
setting.

  Errors in Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</comments><abstract>  We consider a general stochastic input-output dynamical system with output
evolving in time as the solution to a functional coefficients, It\^{o}'s
stochastic differential equation, excited by an input process. This general
class of stochastic systems encompasses not only the classical communication
channel models, but also a wide variety of engineering systems appearing
through a whole range of applications. For this general setting we find
analogous of known relationships linking input-output mutual information and
minimum mean causal and non-causal square errors, previously established in the
context of additive Gaussian noise communication channels. Relationships are
not only established in terms of time-averaged quantities, but also their
time-instantaneous, dynamical counterparts are presented. The problem of
appropriately introducing in this general framework a signal-to-noise ratio
notion expressed through a signal-to-noise ratio parameter is also taken into
account, identifying conditions for a proper and meaningful interpretation.

receiver, and eavesdropper all have multiple antennas. We characterize the
secrecy capacity as the saddle-value of a minimax problem. Among other

secrecy capacity characterization of Csisz{\'a}r and K{\&quot;o}rner when applied to

reveals several useful insights into the conditions under which secure

  Channels</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>6 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ICC 2008</comments><abstract>  A multiple transmit antenna, single receive antenna (per receiver) downlink
channel with limited channel feedback is considered. Given a constraint on the
total system-wide channel feedback, the following question is considered: is it
preferable to get low-rate feedback from a large number of receivers or to
receive high-rate/high-quality feedback from a smaller number of (randomly
selected) receivers? Acquiring feedback from many users allows multi-user
diversity to be exploited, while high-rate feedback allows for very precise
selection of beamforming directions. It is shown that systems in which a
limited number of users feedback high-rate channel information significantly
outperform low-rate/many user systems. While capacity increases only double
logarithmically with the number of users, the marginal benefit of channel
feedback is very significant up to the point where the CSI is essentially
perfect.

Theory, 2009, vol. 55, no. 6, 2766-2775.</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A clear understanding the behavior of the error probability (EP) as a
function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and other system parameters is
fundamental for assessing the design of digital wireless communication
systems.We propose an analytical framework based on the log-concavity property
of the EP which we prove for a wide family of multidimensional modulation
formats in the presence of Gaussian disturbances and fading. Based on this
property, we construct a class of local bounds for the EP that improve known
generic bounds in a given region of the SNR and are invertible, as well as
easily tractable for further analysis. This concept is motivated by the fact
that communication systems often operate with performance in a certain region
of interest (ROI) and, thus, it may be advantageous to have tighter bounds
within this region instead of generic bounds valid for all SNRs. We present a
possible application of these local bounds, but their relevance is beyond the
example made in this paper.

the competitive multi-armed bandit problem. First, the scenario in which a
single cognitive user wishes to opportunistically exploit the availability of
empty frequency bands in the spectrum with multiple bands is considered. In
this scenario, the availability probability of each channel is unknown to the
cognitive user a priori. Hence efficient medium access strategies must strike a
balance between exploring the availability of other free channels and
exploiting the opportunities identified thus far. By adopting a Bayesian
approach for this classical bandit problem, the optimal medium access strategy
is derived and its underlying recursive structure is illustrated via examples.
To avoid the prohibitive computational complexity of the optimal strategy, a
low complexity asymptotically optimal strategy is developed. The proposed
strategy does not require any prior statistical knowledge about the traffic
pattern on the different channels. Next, the multi-cognitive user scenario is
considered and low complexity medium access protocols, which strike the optimal
balance between exploration and exploitation in such competitive environments,
are developed. Finally, this formalism is extended to the case in which each
cognitive user is capable of sensing and using multiple channels
simultaneously.

a persistence framework manages the database and the mapping between the

a system of linear equations that has no exact solution. In a typical setting,
one lets $n$ be the number of constraints and $d$ be the number of variables,
with $n \gg d$. Then, existing exact methods find a solution vector in
$O(nd^2)$ time. We present two randomized algorithms that provide very accurate
relative-error approximations to the optimal value and the solution vector of a
least squares approximation problem more rapidly than existing exact
algorithms. Both of our algorithms preprocess the data with the Randomized
Hadamard Transform. One then uniformly randomly samples constraints and solves
the smaller problem on those constraints, and the other performs a sparse
random projection and solves the smaller problem on those projected
coordinates. In both cases, solving the smaller problem provides relative-error
approximations, and, if $n$ is sufficiently larger than $d$, the approximate
solution can be computed in $O(nd \log d)$ time.

are analyzed in the context of the theory of algorithms. Our main concern here
is how and under what conditions algorithmic interactive devices can be more
powerful than the recursive models of computation, such as Turing machines.
Realization of such a higher computing power makes these systems
superrecursive. We find here five sources for superrecursiveness in
interaction. In addition, we prove that when all of these sources are excluded,
the algorithmic interactive system in question is able to perform only
recursive computations. These results provide computer scientists with
necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving superrecursiveness by
algorithmic interactive devices.

conservatively approximate liveness by reachability from program variables. In
this paper, we describe a sequence of static analyses that takes as input a
program written in a first-order, eager functional programming language, and
finds at each program point the references to objects that are guaranteed not
to be used in the future. Such references are made null by a transformation
pass. If this makes the object unreachable, it can be collected by the garbage
collector. This causes more garbage to be collected, resulting in fewer
collections. Additionally, for those garbage collectors which scavenge live
objects, it makes each collection faster.
  The interesting aspects of our method are both in the identification of the
analyses required to solve the problem and the way they are carried out. We
identify three different analyses -- liveness, sharing and accessibility. In
liveness and sharing analyses, the function definitions are analyzed
independently of the calling context. This is achieved by using a variable to
represent the unknown context of the function being analyzed and setting up
constraints expressing the effect of the function with respect to the variable.
The solution of the constraints is a summary of the function that is
parameterized with respect to a calling context and is used to analyze function
calls. As a result we achieve context sensitivity at call sites without
analyzing the function multiple number of times.

solely based on the information that was available at system startup within a
constant-size neighbourhood of the node. We study the applicability of local
algorithms to max-min LPs where the objective is to maximise $\min_k \sum_v
c_{kv} x_v$ subject to $\sum_v a_{iv} x_v \le 1$ for each $i$ and $x_v \ge 0$
for each $v$. Here $c_{kv} \ge 0$, $a_{iv} \ge 0$, and the support sets $V_i =
\{v : a_{iv} &gt; 0 \}$, $V_k = \{v : c_{kv}&gt;0 \}$, $I_v = \{i : a_{iv} &gt; 0 \}$
and $K_v = \{k : c_{kv} &gt; 0 \}$ have bounded size. In the distributed setting,
each agent $v$ is responsible for choosing the value of $x_v$, and the
communication network is a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ where the sets $V_k$ and
$V_i$ constitute the hyperedges. We present inapproximability results for a
wide range of structural assumptions; for example, even if $|V_i|$ and $|V_k|$
are bounded by some constants larger than 2, there is no local approximation
scheme. To contrast the negative results, we present a local approximation
algorithm which achieves good approximation ratios if we can bound the relative
growth of the vertex neighbourhoods in $\mathcal{H}$.

to a large extent, a consequence of demographic dynamics within the population
of speakers of each language. A two-parameter stochastic multiplicative process
is proposed as a model for the population dynamics of individual languages, and
applied over a period spanning the last ten centuries. The model disregards
language birth and death. A straightforward fitting of the two parameters,
which statistically characterize the population growth rate, predicts a
distribution of language sizes in excellent agreement with empirical data.
Numerical simulations, and the study of the size distribution within language
families, validate the assumptions at the basis of the model.

  Conference on Communication, Control and Computing, September 2007</comments><abstract>  We analyze a slow-fading interference network with MN non-cooperating
single-antenna sources and M non-cooperating single-antenna destinations. In
particular, we assume that the sources are divided into M mutually exclusive
groups of N sources each, every group is dedicated to transmit a common message
to a unique destination, all transmissions occur concurrently and in the same
frequency band and a dedicated 1-bit broadcast feedback channel from each
destination to its corresponding group of sources exists. We provide a
feedback-based iterative distributed (multi-user) beamforming algorithm, which
&quot;learns&quot; the channels between each group of sources and its assigned
destination. This algorithm is a straightforward generalization, to the
multi-user case, of the feedback-based iterative distributed beamforming
algorithm proposed recently by Mudumbai et al., in IEEE Trans. Inf. Th.
(submitted) for networks with a single group of sources and a single
destination. Putting the algorithm into a Markov chain context, we provide a
simple convergence proof. We then show that, for M finite and N approaching
infinity, spatial multiplexing based on the beamforming weights produced by the
algorithm achieves full spatial multiplexing gain of M and full per-stream
array gain of N, provided the time spent &quot;learning'' the channels scales
linearly in N. The network is furthermore shown to &quot;crystallize''. Finally, we
characterize the corresponding crystallization rate.

A preliminary (now outdated) version was

of intervals, called witnesses, that are incomparable with respect to inclusion
(i.e., they form an antichain): witnesses define the minimal regions of the
document satisfying the query. Minimal-interval semantics makes it easy to
define and compute several sophisticated proximity operators, provides snippets
for user presentation, and can be used to rank documents. In this paper we
provide algorithms for computing conjunction and disjunction that are linear in
the number of intervals and logarithmic in the number of operands; for
additional operators, such as ordered conjunction and Brouwerian difference, we
provide linear algorithms. In all cases, space is linear in the number of
operands. More importantly, we define a formal notion of optimal laziness, and
either prove it, or prove its impossibility, for each algorithm. Optimal
laziness implies that the algorithms do not assume random access to the input
intervals, and read as little input as possible to produce a certain output. We
cast our results in the general framework of antichain completions of interval
orders, making our algorithms directly applicable to other domains.

  LDPC Codes</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>8 pages, 1 table</comments><abstract>  Despite the NP hardness of acquiring minimum distance $d_m$ for linear codes
theoretically, in this paper we propose one experimental method of finding
minimum-weight codewords, the weight of which is equal to $d_m$ for LDPC codes.
One existing syndrome decoding method, called serial belief propagation (BP)
with ordered statistic decoding (OSD), is adapted to serve our purpose. We hold
the conjecture that among many candidate error patterns in OSD reprocessing,
modulo 2 addition of the lightest error pattern with one of the left error
patterns may generate a light codeword. When the decoding syndrome changes to
all-zero state, the lightest error pattern reduces to all-zero, the lightest
non-zero error pattern is a valid codeword to update lightest codeword list.
  Given sufficient codewords sending, the survived lightest codewords are
likely to be the target. Compared with existing techniques, our method
demonstrates its efficiency in the simulation of several interested LDPC codes.

  Multiplexing Point</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>5 pages,5 figures, conference</comments><abstract>  This paper studies the performance of transmission schemes that have rate
that increases with average SNR while maintaining a fixed outage probability.
This is in contrast to the classical Zheng-Tse diversity-multiplexing tradeoff
(DMT) that focuses on increasing rate and decreasing outage probability. Three
different systems are explored: antenna diversity systems, time/frequency
diversity systems, and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems. In order to
accurately study performance in the fixed outage setting, it is necesary to go
beyond the coarse, asymptotic multiplexing gain metric. In the case of antenna
diversity and time/frequency diversity, an affine approximation to high SNR
outage capacity (i.e., multiplexing gain plus a power/rate offset) accurately
describes performance and shows the very significant benefits of diversity. ARQ
is also seen to provide a significant performance advantage, but even an affine
approximation to outage capacity is unable to capture this advantage and outage
capacity must be directly studied in the non-asymptotic regime.

error correction (QEC) code in the presence of a correlated environment.
Starting from a Hamiltonian formulation of realistic noise models, and assuming
that QEC is indeed possible, we find formal expressions for the probability of
a faulty path and the residual decoherence encoded in the reduced density
matrix. Systems with non-zero gate times (``long gates'') are included in our
analysis by using an upper bound on the noise. In order to introduce the local
error probability for a qubit, we assume that propagation of signals through
the environment is slower than the QEC period (hypercube assumption). This
allows an explicit calculation in the case of a generalized spin-boson model
and a quantum frustration model. The key result is a dimensional criterion: If
the correlations decay sufficiently fast, the system evolves toward a
stochastic error model for which the threshold theorem of fault-tolerant
quantum computation has been proven. On the other hand, if the correlations
decay slowly, the traditional proof of this threshold theorem does not hold.
This dimensional criterion bears many similarities to criteria that occur in
the theory of quantum phase transitions.

  Multipath Routing Strategy</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>7 Pages, 4 Figures, 2007 Allerton Conference on Communication,
  Control and Computing</comments><abstract>  Franceschetti et al. have recently shown that per-node throughput in an
extended, ad hoc wireless network with $\Theta(n)$ randomly distributed nodes
and multihop routing can be increased from the $\Omega({1 \over \sqrt{n} \log
n})$ scaling demonstrated in the seminal paper of Gupta and Kumar to $\Omega({1
\over \sqrt{n}})$. The goal of the present paper is to understand the
dependence of this interesting result on the principal new features it
introduced relative to Gupta-Kumar: (1) a capacity-based formula for link
transmission bit-rates in terms of received signal-to-interference-and-noise
ratio (SINR); (2) hierarchical routing from sources to destinations through a
system of communal highways; and (3) cell-based routes constructed by
percolation. The conclusion of the present paper is that the improved
throughput scaling is principally due to the percolation-based routing, which
enables shorter hops and, consequently, less interference. This is established
by showing that throughput $\Omega({1 \over \sqrt{n}})$ can be attained by a
system that does not employ highways, but instead uses percolation to
establish, for each source-destination pair, a set of $\Theta(\log n)$ routes
within a narrow routing corridor running from source to destination. As a
result, highways are not essential. In addition, it is shown that throughput
$\Omega({1 \over \sqrt{n}})$ can be attained with the original threshold
transmission bit-rate model, provided that node transmission powers are
permitted to grow with $n$. Thus, the benefit of the capacity bit-rate model is
simply to permit the power to remain bounded, even as the network expands.

resulting geometric graph has no crossings. Pach and Tardos [Discrete Comput.
Geom., 2002] asked if every n-vertex geometric planar graph can be untangled
while keeping at least n^\epsilon vertices fixed. We answer this question in
the affirmative with \epsilon=1/4. The previous best known bound was
\Omega((\log n / \log\log n)^{1/2}). We also consider untangling geometric
trees. It is known that every n-vertex geometric tree can be untangled while
keeping at least (n/3)^{1/2} vertices fixed, while the best upper bound was
O(n\log n)^{2/3}. We answer a question of Spillner and Wolff [arXiv:0709.0170
2007] by closing this gap for untangling trees. In particular, we show that for
infinitely many values of n, there is an n-vertex geometric tree that cannot be
untangled while keeping more than 3(n^{1/2}-1) vertices fixed. Moreover, we
improve the lower bound to (n/2)^{1/2}.

participation fostering design-use mediation during the Open Source Software
design process Research approach - We compare online interactions for a
successful &quot;pushed-by-users&quot; design process with unsuccessful previous
proposals. The methodology developed, articulate structural analyses of the
discussions (organization of discussions, participation) to actions to the code
and documentation made by participants to the project. We focus on the
useroriented and the developer-oriented mailing-lists of the Python project.
Findings/Design - We find that key-participants, the cross-participants, foster
the design process and act as boundary spanners between the users and the
developers' communities. Research limitations/Implications - These findings can
be reinforced developing software to automate the structural analysis of
discussions and actions to the code and documentation. Further analyses,
supported by these tools, will be necessary to generalise our results.
Originality/Value - The analysis of participation among the three interaction
spaces of OSS design (discussion, documentation and implementation) is the main
originality of this work compared to other OSS research that mainly analyse one
or two spaces. Take away message - Beside the idealistic picture that users may
intervene freely in the process, OSS design is boost and framed by some
key-participants and specific rules and there can be barriers to users'
participation

This paper focuses on designing for commutativity, a topic neglected
previously. We show that the replicas of \emph{any} data type for which
concurrent operations commute converges to a correct value, under some simple
and standard assumptions. We also show that such a data type supports
transactions with very low cost. We identify a number of approaches and
techniques to ensure commutativity. We re-use some existing ideas
(non-destructive updates coupled with invariant identification), but propose a
much more efficient implementation. Furthermore, we propose a new technique,
background consensus. We illustrate these ideas with a shared edit buffer data
type.

an iterative algorithm that uses O(n) space. Moreover, the algorithm produces
each successive edge of the cycle in constant time; such algorithms are said to
be loopless.

  Common Subexpression Elimination Algorithm</title><categories>cs.IT cs.CC math.CO math.IT</categories><comments>11 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper, we first propose a novel common subexpression elimination
(CSE) algorithm for matrix-vector multiplications over characteristic-2 fields.
As opposed to previously proposed CSE algorithms, which usually focus on
complexity savings due to recurrences of subexpressions, our CSE algorithm
achieves two types of complexity reductions, differential savings and
recurrence savings, by taking advantage of the cancelation property of
characteristic-2 fields. Using our CSE algorithm, we reduce the additive
complexities of cyclotomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs). Using a weighted
sum of the numbers of multiplications and additions as a metric, our CFFTs
achieve smaller total complexities than previously proposed CFFTs and other
FFTs, requiring both fewer multiplications and fewer additions in many cases.

has closed-form. Bounding techniques are widely used to evaluate the
performance of maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm. But the existing bounds
are not tight enough especially for low signal-to-noise ratios and become
looser when a suboptimum decoding algorithm is used. This paper proposes a new
concept named square radius probability density function (SR-PDF) of decision
region to evaluate the WER. Based on the SR-PDF, The WER of binary block codes
can be calculated precisely for ML and suboptimum decoders. Furthermore, for a
long binary block code, SR-PDF can be approximated by Gamma distribution with
only two parameters that can be measured easily. Using this property, two
closed-form approximative expressions are proposed which are very close to the
simulation results of the WER of interesting.

routing tables, in which routing protocols determine how to update the tables
according to the network changes. Despite the variability of data in routing
tables, node addresses are constant. In this paper, we first introduce the new
concept of variable addresses, which results in a novel framework to cope with
routing problems using heuristic solutions. Then we propose a heuristic routing
mechanism based on the application of genes for determination of network
addresses in a variable address network and describe how this method flexibly
solves different problems and induces new ideas in providing integral solutions
for variety of problems. The case of ad-hoc networks is where simulation
results are more supportive and original solutions have been proposed for
issues like mobility.

  to IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory</comments><abstract>  This paper addresses the problem of coding a continuous random source
correlated with another source which is only available at the decoder. The
proposed approach is based on the extension of the channel coding concept of
syndrome from the discrete into the continuous domain. If the correlation
between the sources can be described by an additive Gaussian backward channel
and capacity-achieving linear codes are employed, it is shown that the
performance of the system is asymptotically close to the Wyner-Ziv bound. Even
if such an additive channel is not Gaussian, the design procedure can fit the
desired correlation and transmission rate. Experiments based on trellis-coded
quantization show that the proposed system achieves a performance within 3-4 dB
of the theoretical bound in the 0.5-3 bit/sample rate range for any Gaussian
correlation, with a reasonable computational complexity.

dots, called ``Kolam'', among which one-line drawings or the ``infinite Kolam''
provide very interesting questions in mathematics. For example, we address the
following simple question: how many patterns of infinite Kolam can we draw for
a given grid pattern of dots? The simplest way is to draw possible patterns of
Kolam while judging if it is infinite Kolam. Such a search problem seems to be
NP complete. However, it is certainly not. In this paper, we focus on
diamond-shaped grid patterns of dots, (1-3-5-3-1) and (1-3-5-7-5-3-1) in
particular. By using the knot-theory description of the infinite Kolam, we show
how to find the solution, which inevitably gives a sketch of the proof for the
statement ``infinite Kolam is not NP complete.'' Its further discussion will be
given in the final section.

  communication, control, and computing, Allerton house, Monticello, IL, USA</comments><abstract>  The cognitive interference channel with confidential messages is studied.
Similarly to the classical two-user interference channel, the cognitive
interference channel consists of two transmitters whose signals interfere at
the two receivers. It is assumed that there is a common message source (message
1) known to both transmitters, and an additional independent message source
(message 2) known only to the cognitive transmitter (transmitter 2). The
cognitive receiver (receiver 2) needs to decode both messages, while the
non-cognitive receiver (receiver 1) should decode only the common message.
Furthermore, message 2 is assumed to be a confidential message which needs to
be kept as secret as possible from receiver 1, which is viewed as an
eavesdropper with regard to message 2. The level of secrecy is measured by the
equivocation rate. A single-letter expression for the capacity-equivocation
region of the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel is established
and is further explicitly derived for the Gaussian case. Moreover,
particularizing the capacity-equivocation region to the case without a secrecy
constraint, establishes a new capacity theorem for a class of interference
channels, by providing a converse theorem.

rules. Association rules represent significant relationships between items in
transactions. We extend the concept of association rule to represent a much
broader class of associations, which we refer to as \emph{entity-relationship
rules.} Semantically, entity-relationship rules express associations between
properties of related objects. Syntactically, these rules are based on a broad
subclass of safe domain relational calculus queries. We propose a new
definition of support and confidence for entity-relationship rules and for the
frequency of entity-relationship queries. We prove that the definition of
frequency satisfies standard probability axioms and the Apriori property.

respect to a simple degree-thresholding renormalization scheme finds a natural
interpretation in the assumption that network nodes exist in hidden metric
spaces. Clustering, i.e., cycles of length three, plays a crucial role in this
framework as a topological reflection of the triangle inequality in the hidden
geometry. We prove that a class of hidden variable models with underlying
metric spaces are able to accurately reproduce the self-similarity properties
that we measured in the real networks. Our findings indicate that hidden
geometries underlying these real networks are a plausible explanation for their
observed topologies and, in particular, for their self-similarity with respect
to the degree-based renormalization.

well-known dominating set problem: find a smallest-size set of nodes $S$ that
power dominates all the nodes, where a node $v$ is power dominated if (1) $v$
is in $S$ or $v$ has a neighbor in $S$, or (2) $v$ has a neighbor $w$ such that
$w$ and all of its neighbors except $v$ are power dominated. We show a hardness
of approximation threshold of $2^{\log^{1-\epsilon}{n}}$ in contrast to the
logarithmic hardness for the dominating set problem. We give an $O(\sqrt{n})$
approximation algorithm for planar graphs, and show that our methods cannot
improve on this approximation guarantee. Finally, we initiate the study of PDS
on directed graphs, and show the same hardness threshold of
$2^{\log^{1-\epsilon}{n}}$ for directed \emph{acyclic} graphs. Also we show
that the directed PDS problem can be solved optimally in linear time if the
underlying undirected graph has bounded tree-width.

an automated and accurate tool to predict subcellular localization becomes
increasingly important. Many efforts have been made to predict protein
subcellular localization. This paper aims to merge the artificial neural

We introduce a new subcellular prediction method based on a backpropagation

  Handwritten Character Recognition: Topping the MNIST Benchmark</title><categories>cs.CV</categories><comments>13 pages</comments><abstract>  Although the recognition of isolated handwritten digits has been a research
topic for many years, it continues to be of interest for the research community
and for commercial applications. We show that despite the maturity of the
field, different approaches still deliver results that vary enough to allow
improvements by using their combination. We do so by choosing four
well-motivated state-of-the-art recognition systems for which results on the
standard MNIST benchmark are available. When comparing the errors made, we
observe that the errors made differ between all four systems, suggesting the
use of classifier combination. We then determine the error rate of a
hypothetical system that combines the output of the four systems. The result
obtained in this manner is an error rate of 0.35% on the MNIST data, the best
result published so far. We furthermore discuss the statistical significance of
the combined result and of the results of the individual classifiers.

defined. We show that the ELC orbit of a bipartite graph corresponds to the
equivalence class of a binary linear code. The information sets and the minimum
distance of a code can be derived from the corresponding ELC orbit. By
extending earlier results on local complementation (LC) orbits, we classify the
ELC orbits of all graphs on up to 12 vertices. We also give a new method for
classifying binary linear codes, with running time comparable to the best known
algorithm.

Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), due to the common knowledge creating
effects of its synchronous communication primitives. We then prove that CSP
with input and output guards makes common knowledge in symmetric peer-to-peer
networks possible, but not the restricted version which disallows output
statements in guards and is commonly implemented.

constant $\beta&gt;0$ if every $U\subseteq V$ of cardinality $|U|\leq \frac{n}{2}$
satisfies $|N_G(U)|\geq \beta|U|$ where $N_G(U)$ denotes the neighborhood of
$U$. In this work we explore the process of deleting vertices of a
$\beta$-expander independently at random with probability $n^{-\alpha}$ for
some constant $\alpha&gt;0$, and study the properties of the resulting graph. Our
main result states that as $n$ tends to infinity, the deletion process
performed on a $\beta$-expander graph of bounded degree will result with high
probability in a graph composed of a giant component containing $n-o(n)$
vertices that is in itself an expander graph, and constant size components. We
proceed by applying the main result to expander graphs with a positive spectral
gap. In the particular case of $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs, that are such expanders,
we compute the values of $\alpha$, under additional constraints on the graph,
for which with high probability the resulting graph will stay connected, or
will be composed of a giant component and isolated vertices. As a graph sampled
from the uniform probability space of $d$-regular graphs with high probability
is an expander and meets the additional constraints, this result strengthens a
recent result due to Greenhill, Holt and Wormald about vertex percolation on
random $d$-regular graphs. We conclude by showing that performing the above
described deletion process on graphs that expand sub-linear sets by an
unbounded expansion ratio, with high probability results in a connected
expander graph.

By
adding to them draw positions, they have been organized by Arnold and one of
the authors into a mu-calculus. As done by Berwanger et al. for the
propositional modal mu-calculus, it is possible to classify parity games into
levels of a hierarchy according to the number of fixed-point variables. We ask
whether this hierarchy collapses w.r.t. the standard interpretation of the
games mu-calculus into the class of all complete lattices. We answer this
question negatively by providing, for each n &gt;= 1, a parity game Gn with these
properties: it unravels to a mu-term built up with n fixed-point variables, it
is semantically equivalent to no game with strictly less than n-2 fixed-point
variables.

unsupervised training allowing the discovery of the structure of sequential

sentences. It provided a classification of the links between two successive
verbs into four distinct clusters, allowing thus text segmentation. We give
here an interpretation of these clusters by applying a statistical analysis to
independent semantic annotations.

positive result, it is shown that there is no consistent estimation scheme for
the family of stable sequences whose regression functions have finite
variation, even under the restriction that $x_i \in [0,1]$ and $y_i$ is

notably with different forms of branching such as non-determinism vs.
probability. In this paper we claim to identify one underlying mathematical
structure behind these &quot;trace semantics,&quot; namely coinduction in a Kleisli
category. This claim is based on our technical result that, under a suitably
order-enriched setting, a final coalgebra in a Kleisli category is given by an
initial algebra in the category Sets. Formerly the theory of coalgebras has
been employed mostly in Sets where coinduction yields a finer process semantics
of bisimilarity. Therefore this paper extends the application field of
coalgebras, providing a new instance of the principle &quot;process semantics via
coinduction.&quot;

reliable broadcast on a radio network under the following popular model. Each
node in the network is located on a point in a two dimensional grid, and
whenever a node sends a message, all awake nodes within distance r receive the
message. In the broadcast problem, some node wants to successfully send a
message to all other nodes in the network even when up to a 1/2 fraction of the
nodes within every neighborhood can be deleted by an adversary. The set of
deleted nodes is carefully chosen by the adversary to foil our algorithm and
moreover, the set of deleted nodes may change periodically. This models
worst-case behavior due to mobile nodes, static nodes losing power or simply
some points in the grid being unoccupied. A trivial solution requires each node
in the network to be awake roughly 1/2 the time, and a trivial lower bound
shows that each node must be awake for at least a 1/n fraction of the time. Our
first result is an algorithm that requires each node to be awake for only a
1/sqrt(n) fraction of the time in expectation. Our algorithm achieves this
while ensuring correctness with probability 1, and keeping optimal values for
other resource costs such as latency and number of messages sent. We give a
lower-bound that shows that this reduction in power consumption is
asymptotically optimal when latency and number of messages sent must be
optimal. If we can increase the latency and messages sent by only a log*n
factor we give a Las Vegas algorithm that requires each node to be awake for
only a (log*n)/n expected fraction of the time; we give a lower-bound showing
that this second algorithm is near optimal. Finally, we show how to ensure
energy-efficient broadcast in the presence of Byzantine faults.

communicates to a local base station via a dedicated relay (two-hop
communication). Exploiting the possibly relevant inter-cell channel gains, rate
splitting with successive cancellation in both hops is investigated as a
promising solution to improve the rate of basic single-rate communications.
Then, an alternative solution is proposed that attempts to improve the
performance of the second hop (from the relays to base stations) by cooperative
transmission among the relay stations. The cooperative scheme leverages the
common information obtained by the relays as a by-product of the use of rate
splitting in the first hop. Numerical results bring insight into the conditions
(network topology and power constraints) under which rate splitting, with
possible relay cooperation, is beneficial. Multi-cell processing (joint
decoding at the base stations) is also considered for reference.

convolution-bound $n$-tuples, but the $n$-tuples cannot be regarded as vectors
since the formalism is basis dependent. This is why HRR cannot be associated
with geometric structures. Replacing convolutions by geometric products one
arrives at reduced representations analogous to HRR but interpretable in terms
of geometry. Variable bindings occurring in both HRR and its geometric analogue
mathematically correspond to two different representations of
$Z_2\times...\times Z_2$ (the additive group of binary $n$-tuples with addition
modulo 2). As opposed to standard HRR, variable binding performed by means of
geometric product allows for computing exact inverses of all nonzero vectors, a
procedure even simpler than approximate inverses employed in HRR. The formal
structure of the new reduced representation is analogous to cartoon
computation, a geometric analogue of quantum computation.

underlying model of a formation is graphical. We first analyze the rigidity and
persistence of meta-formations, which are formations obtained by connecting
several rigid or persistent formations. Persistence is a generalization to
directed graphs of the undirected notion of rigidity. In the context of moving
autonomous agent formations, persistence characterizes the efficacy of a
directed structure of unilateral distance constraints seeking to preserve a
formation shape. We derive then, for agents evolving in a two- or
three-dimensional space, the conditions under which a set of persistent
formations can be merged into a persistent meta-formation, and give the minimal
number of interconnections needed for such a merging. We also give conditions
for a meta-formation obtained by merging several persistent formations to be
persistent.

collusion-resistant coding/decoding schemes for digital fingerprinting. More
specifically, the minimum distance decision rule is used to identify 1 out of t
pirates. Achievable rates, under this detection rule, are characterized in two
distinct scenarios. First, we consider the averaging attack where a random
coding argument is used to show that the rate 1/2 is achievable with t=2
pirates. Our study is then extended to the general case of arbitrary $t$
highlighting the underlying complexity-performance tradeoff. Overall, these
results establish the significant performance gains offered by minimum distance
decoding as compared to other approaches based on orthogonal codes and
correlation detectors. In the second scenario, we characterize the achievable
rates, with minimum distance decoding, under any collusion attack that
satisfies the marking assumption. For t=2 pirates, we show that the rate
$1-H(0.25)\approx 0.188$ is achievable using an ensemble of random linear
codes. For $t\geq 3$, the existence of a non-resolvable collusion attack, with
minimum distance decoding, for any non-zero rate is established. Inspired by
our theoretical analysis, we then construct coding/decoding schemes for
fingerprinting based on the celebrated Belief-Propagation framework. Using an
explicit repeat-accumulate code, we obtain a vanishingly small probability of
misidentification at rate 1/3 under averaging attack with t=2. For collusion
attacks which satisfy the marking assumption, we use a more sophisticated
accumulate repeat accumulate code to obtain a vanishingly small
misidentification probability at rate 1/9 with t=2. These results represent a
marked improvement over the best available designs in the literature.

dynamical networks is discussed. A cost function of the controlled network is
defined by the feedback gain and the coupling strength of the network. An
interesting result is that lower cost is achieved by the control scheme of
pinning nodes with smaller degrees. Some rigorous mathematical analysis is
presented for achieving lower cost in the synchronization of different
star-shaped networks. Numerical simulations on some non-regular complex
networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and various star-shaped
networks are shown for verification and illustration.

complexity of recognizing the $2n$-dimensional orthant, on the other hand the
probabilistic communication complexity of its recognizing does not exceed 4. A
polyhedron and a union of hyperplanes are constructed in $\RR^{2n}$ for which a
lower bound $n/2$ on the probabilistic communication complexity of recognizing
each is proved. As a consequence this bound holds also for the EMPTINESS and

  synthesis of complex networks</title><categories>cs.NI</categories><comments>15 peges, 11 figures</comments><acm-class>C.2.1</acm-class><abstract>  In this paper, the synchronizability problem of dynamical networks is
addressed, where better synchronizability means that the network synchronizes
faster with lower-overshoot. The L2 norm of the error vector e is taken as a
performance index to measure this kind of synchronizability. For the
equilibrium synchronization case, it is shown that there is a close
relationship between the L2 norm of the error vector e and the H2 norm of the
transfer function G of the linearized network about the equilibrium point.
Consequently, the effect of the network coupling topology on the H2 norm of the
transfer function G is analyzed. Finally, an optimal controller is designed,
according to the so-called LQR problem in modern control theory, which can
drive the whole network to its equilibrium point and meanwhile minimize the L2
norm of the output of the linearized network.

a powerful approach for evolutionary computation. Increasingly more complex
models have been used by estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), which
often result better effectiveness on finding the global optima for hard
optimization problems. Supervised and unsupervised learning of Bayesian
networks are very effective options, since those models are able to capture
interactions of high order among the variables of a problem. Diversity
preservation, through niching techniques, has also shown to be very important
to allow the identification of the problem structure as much as for keeping
several global optima. Recently, clustering was evaluated as an effective
niching technique for EDAs, but the performance of simpler low-order EDAs was
not shown to be much improved by clustering, except for some simple multimodal
problems. This work proposes and evaluates a combination operator guided by a
measure from information theory which allows a clustered low-order EDA to
effectively solve a comprehensive range of benchmark optimization problems.

Polish to illustrate our discussion because it has an interesting aspectual

goal is to develop theoretical and computational tools for temporal model
building tasks in computational semantics. To this end, we present a
first-order theory of time and events which is rich enough to capture
interesting semantic distinctions, and an algorithm which takes minimal models
for first-order theories and systematically attempts to ``perturb'' their
temporal component to provide non-minimal, but semantically significant,
models.

to bring researchers and practitioners both from academia and industry
together, with a spirit of openness, to try and identify and begin to address
the numerous and very varied issues of optimization. This succeeded, as can be
seen from the papers, the attendance and the liveliness of the discussions that
took place during and after the workshop, not to mention a few new cooperations
or postdoctoral contracts. The 22 talented people from different groups who
participated were unanimous to appreciate this first edition and recommend that
ICOOOLPS be continued next year. A community is thus beginning to form, and
should be reinforced by a second edition next year, with all the improvements
this first edition made emerge.

ranking to binary classification. The reduction guarantees an average pairwise
misranking regret of at most that of the binary classifier regret, improving a
recent result of Balcan et al which only guarantees a factor of 2. Moreover,
our reduction applies to a broader class of ranking loss functions, admits a
simpler proof, and the expected running time complexity of our algorithm in
terms of number of calls to a classifier or preference function is improved
from $\Omega(n^2)$ to $O(n \log n)$. In addition, when the top $k$ ranked
elements only are required ($k \ll n$), as in many applications in information
extraction or search engines, the time complexity of our algorithm can be
further reduced to $O(k \log k + n)$. Our reduction and algorithm are thus
practical for realistic applications where the number of points to rank exceeds
several thousands. Much of our results also extend beyond the bipartite case
previously studied.
  Our rediction is a randomized one. To complement our result, we also derive
lower bounds on any deterministic reduction from binary (preference)
classification to ranking, implying that our use of a randomized reduction is
essentially necessary for the guarantees we provide.

in scenarios where the only a priori information about the channel used for the
transmission of information is that it belongs to a given set of memoryless
classical-quantum channels. Our approach is based on the universal classical
approximation of the quantum relative entropy which in turn relies on the
universal hypothesis testing results.

function (IMF) components of time series data. This method is faster and more
predictable than the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method devised by the
author of Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT). The approach is to transforms the
original data function into a piecewise linear sawtooth function (or triangle
wave function), then directly constructs the upper envelope by connecting the
maxima and construct lower envelope by connecting minima with straight line
segments in the sawtooth space, the IMF is calculated as the difference between
the sawtooth function and the mean of the upper and lower envelopes. The
results found in the sawtooth space are reversely transformed into the original
data space as the required IMF and envelopes mean. This decomposition method
process the data in one pass to obtain a unique IMF component without the time
consuming repetitive sifting process of EMD method. An alternative
decomposition method with sawtooth function expansion is also presented.

technical and specialist end-users. In end-user informatics the end-users are
always right. So it becomes necessary for information technology professionals
to understand information and informatics from the end-user perspective.
End-user informatics starts with the observation that practical prose is a mass
consensus communal modeling technology. This high technology is the mechanistic
modeling medium we all use every day in all of our practical pursuits.
Practical information flows are the lifeblood of modern capitalist communities.
But what exactly is practical information? It's ultimately physical
information, but the physics is highly emergent rather than elementary. So
practical reality is just physical reality in deep disguise. Practical prose is
the medium that we all use to model the everyday and elite mechanics of
practical reality. So this is the medium that end-user informatics must
automate and animate.

being developed for bedside use in critical care medicine. Aiming at improving
the chest anatomical resolution of EIT images we developed a fuzzy model based
on EIT high temporal resolution and the functional information contained in the
pulmonary perfusion and ventilation signals. EIT data from an experimental
animal model were collected during normal ventilation and apnea while an
injection of hypertonic saline was used as a reference . The fuzzy model was
elaborated in three parts: a modeling of the heart, a pulmonary map from
ventilation images and, a pulmonary map from perfusion images. Image
segmentation was performed using a threshold method and a ventilation/perfusion
map was generated. EIT images treated by the fuzzy model were compared with the
hypertonic saline injection method and CT-scan images, presenting good results
in both qualitative (the image obtained by the model was very similar to that
of the CT-scan) and quantitative (the ROC curve provided an area equal to 0.93)
point of view. Undoubtedly, these results represent an important step in the
EIT images area, since they open the possibility of developing EIT-based
bedside clinical methods, which are not available nowadays. These achievements
could serve as the base to develop EIT diagnosis system for some
life-threatening diseases commonly found in critical care medicine.

  Systems</title><categories>cs.NI cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>29 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless
  Communications</comments><abstract>  Most existing work on adaptive allocation of subcarriers and power in
multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems has focused
on homogeneous traffic consisting solely of either delay-constrained data
(guaranteed service) or non-delay-constrained data (best-effort service). In
this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problem in a heterogeneous
multiuser OFDM system with both delay-constrained (DC) and
non-delay-constrained (NDC) traffic. The objective is to maximize the sum-rate
of all the users with NDC traffic while maintaining guaranteed rates for the
users with DC traffic under a total transmit power constraint. Through our
analysis we show that the optimal power allocation over subcarriers follows a
multi-level water-filling principle; moreover, the valid candidates competing
for each subcarrier include only one NDC user but all DC users. By converting
this combinatorial problem with exponential complexity into a convex problem or
showing that it can be solved in the dual domain, efficient iterative
algorithms are proposed to find the optimal solutions. To further reduce the
computational cost, a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm is also developed.
Numerical studies are conducted to evaluate the performance the proposed
algorithms in terms of service outage probability, achievable transmission rate
pairs for DC and NDC traffic, and multiuser diversity.

clusters. Weights, inversely proportional to the number of items in
corresponding clusters, are assigned to items. As a result, the C-test
structure becomes similar to the structure of classical tests, without
violation of local independence hypothesis.

  Intruder</title><categories>cs.LO cs.CR</categories><proxy>ccsd inria-00179550</proxy><abstract>  Non-repudiation protocols have an important role in many areas where secured
transactions with proofs of participation are necessary. Formal methods are
clever and without error, therefore using them for verifying such protocols is
crucial. In this purpose, we show how to partially represent non-repudiation as
a combination of authentications on the Fair Zhou-Gollmann protocol. After
discussing its limits, we define a new method based on the handling of the
knowledge of protocol participants. This method is very general and is of
natural use, as it consists in adding simple annotations, like for
authentication problems. The method is very easy to implement in tools able to
handle participants knowledge. We have implemented it in the AVISPA Tool and
analyzed the optimistic Cederquist-Corin- Dashti protocol, discovering two
unknown attacks. This extension of the AVISPA Tool for handling non-repudiation
opens a highway to the specification of many other properties, without any more
change in the tool itself.

structure $M$ and a specification formula $\eta$ in some modal or temporal
logic, determine if $M$ contains a substructure $M'$ (with the same initial
state) that satisfies $\eta$. Thus, $M$ can be ``repaired'' to satisfy the
specification $\eta$ by deleting some transitions.
  We map an instance $(M, \eta)$ of model repair to a boolean formula
$\repfor(M,\eta)$ such that $(M, \eta)$ has a solution iff $\repfor(M,\eta)$ is
satisfiable. Furthermore, a satisfying assignment determines which transitions
must be removed from $M$ to generate a model $M'$ of $\eta$. Thus, we can use
any SAT solver to repair Kripke structures. Furthermore, using a complete SAT
solver yields a complete algorithm: it always finds a repair if one exists.
  We extend our method to repair finite-state shared memory concurrent
programs, to solve the discrete event supervisory control problem
\cite{RW87,RW89}, to check for the existence of symmettric solutions
\cite{ES93}, and to accomodate any boolean constraint on the existence of
states and transitions in the repaired model.
  Finally, we show that model repair is NP-complete for CTL, and logics with
polynomial model checking algorithms to which CTL can be reduced in polynomial
time. A notable example of such a logic is Alternating-Time Temporal Logic
(ATL).

prove that the necessary condition for a code to correct $k \geq 5$ errors is
to avoid cycles of length up to $2k$ in its Tanner graph. As a consequence of

  Transmission</title><categories>cs.NI</categories><comments>6 pages, 5 figures, to appear in IEEE Trans. on Wireless
  Communications</comments><abstract>  For most wireless services with variable rate transmission, both average rate
and rate oscillation are important performance metrics. The traditional
performance criterion, utility of average transmission rate, boosts the average
rate but also results in high rate oscillations. We introduce a utility
function of instantaneous transmission rates. It is capable of facilitating the
resource allocation with flexible combinations of average rate and rate
oscillation. Based on the new utility, we consider the time and power
allocation in a time-shared wireless network. Two adaptation policies are
developed, namely, time sharing (TS) and joint time sharing and power control
(JTPC). An extension to quantized time sharing with limited channel feedback
(QTSL) for practical systems is also discussed. Simulation results show that by
controlling the concavity of the utility function, a tradeoff between the
average rate and rate oscillation can be easily made.

  Information Systems</comments><doi>10.1007/s10844-006-0025-9</doi><abstract>  In this paper we present a fresh look at the problem of summarizing evolving
events from multiple sources. After a discussion concerning the nature of
evolving events we introduce a distinction between linearly and non-linearly
evolving events. We present then a general methodology for the automatic
creation of summaries from evolving events. At its heart lie the notions of
Synchronic and Diachronic cross-document Relations (SDRs), whose aim is the
identification of similarities and differences between sources, from a
synchronical and diachronical perspective. SDRs do not connect documents or
textual elements found therein, but structures one might call messages.
Applying this methodology will yield a set of messages and relations, SDRs,
connecting them, that is a graph which we call grid. We will show how such a
grid can be considered as the starting point of a Natural Language Generation
System. The methodology is evaluated in two case-studies, one for linearly
evolving events (descriptions of football matches) and another one for
non-linearly evolving events (terrorist incidents involving hostages). In both
cases we evaluate the results produced by our computational systems.

Improved version, largely rewritten, submitted
  to Computing in Science &amp; Engineering</comments><abstract>  This paper describes JANUS, a modular massively parallel and reconfigurable
FPGA-based computing system. Each JANUS module has a computational core and a
host. The computational core is a 4x4 array of FPGA-based processing elements
with nearest-neighbor data links. Processors are also directly connected to an
I/O node attached to the JANUS host, a conventional PC. JANUS is tailored for,
but not limited to, the requirements of a class of hard scientific applications
characterized by regular code structure, unconventional data manipulation
instructions and not too large data-base size. We discuss the architecture of
this configurable machine, and focus on its use on Monte Carlo simulations of
statistical mechanics. On this class of application JANUS achieves impressive
performances: in some cases one JANUS processing element outperfoms high-end
PCs by a factor ~ 1000. We also discuss the role of JANUS on other classes of
scientific applications.

possibility correspondences. We first establish a generic result that links
true common beliefs (and, respectively, common knowledge) of players'
rationality defined by means of `monotonic' properties, with the iterated
elimination of strategies that do not satisfy these properties. It allows us to
deduce the customary results concerned with true common beliefs of rationality
and iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies as simple
corollaries. This approach relies on Tarski's Fixpoint Theorem. We also provide
an axiomatic presentation of this generic result. This allows us to clarify the
proof-theoretic principles assumed in players' reasoning. Finally, we provide
an alternative characterization of the iterated elimination of strategies based
on the concept of a public announcement. It applies to `global properties'.
Both classes of properties include the notions of rationalizability and the
iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies.

estimation procedure involves a controlled number of linear operations, with a
computational cost per iteration that grows linearly with problem size.

alternative integer programming formulations have recently attracted
considerable attention. This paper briefly surveys seven known formulations of
vertex colouring and introduces a formulation of vertex colouring using a
suitable clique partition of the graph. This formulation is applicable in
timetabling applications, where such a clique partition of the conflict graph
is given implicitly. In contrast with some alternatives, the presented
formulation can also be easily extended to accommodate complex performance
indicators (``soft constraints'') imposed in a number of real-life course
timetabling applications. Its performance depends on the quality of the clique
partition, but encouraging empirical results for the Udine Course Timetabling
problem are reported.

water vapor. Water molecules in the gas phase selectively absorb T-rays at
discrete frequencies corresponding to their molecular rotational transitions.
This results in prominent resonances spread over the T-ray spectrum, and in the
time domain the T-ray signal is observed as fluctuations after the main pulse.
These effects are generally undesired, since they may mask critical
spectroscopic data. So, ambient water vapor is commonly removed from the T-ray
path by using a closed chamber during the measurement. Yet, in some
applications a closed chamber is not applicable. This situation, therefore,
motivates the need for another method to reduce these unwanted artifacts. This
paper presents a study on a computational means to address the problem.
Initially, a complex frequency response of water vapor is modeled from a
spectroscopic catalog. Using a deconvolution technique, together with fine
tuning of the strength of each resonance, parts of the water-vapor response are
removed from a measured T-ray signal, with minimal signal distortion.

cross-compilation) or just in time (embedded and usually dynamic). The
heuristics used in dynamic compilation are highly constrained by limited
resources, time and memory in particular. Recent results on the SSA form open
promising directions for the design of new register allocation heuristics for
embedded systems and especially for embedded compilation. In particular,
heuristics based on tree scan with two separated phases -- one for spilling,
then one for coloring/coalescing -- seem good candidates for designing
memory-friendly, fast, and competitive register allocators. Still, also because
of the side effect on power consumption, the minimization of loads and stores
overhead (spilling problem) is an important issue. This paper provides an
exhaustive study of the complexity of the ``spill everywhere'' problem in the
context of the SSA form. Unfortunately, conversely to our initial hopes, many
of the questions we raised lead to NP-completeness results. We identify some
polynomial cases but that are impractical in JIT context. Nevertheless, they
can give hints to simplify formulations for the design of aggressive
allocators.

of multiuser wireless communication. We consider a model for a wireless network
with nodes connected by such deterministic channels, and present an exact
characterization of the end-to-end capacity when there is a single source and a
single destination and an arbitrary number of relay nodes. This result is a
natural generalization of the max-flow min-cut theorem for wireline networks.
Finally to demonstrate the connections between deterministic model and Gaussian
model, we look at two examples: the single-relay channel and the diamond
network. We show that in each of these two examples, the capacity-achieving
scheme in the corresponding deterministic model naturally suggests a scheme in
the Gaussian model that is within 1 bit and 2 bit respectively from cut-set
upper bound, for all values of the channel gains. This is the first part of a
two-part paper; the sequel [1] will focus on the proof of the max-flow min-cut
theorem of a class of deterministic networks of which our model is a special
case.

  in SoC</title><categories>cs.AR</categories><comments>5 pages, 9 figures, Submitted to ICCSC 2008</comments><abstract>  Reduction in power consumption has become a major criterion of design in
modern ICs. One such scheme to reduce power consumption by an IC is the use of
multiple power supplies for critical and non-critical paths. To maintain the
impedance of a power distribution system below a specified level, multiple
decoupling capacitors are placed at different levels of power grid hierarchy.
This paper describes about three-voltage supply power distribution systems. The
noise at one power supply can propagate to the other power supply, causing
power and signal integrity problems in the overall system. Effects such as
anti-resonance and remedies for these effects are studied. Impedance of the
three-voltage supply power distribution system is calculated in terms of
RLC-model of decoupling capacitors. Further the obtained impedance depends on
the frequency; hence brief frequency analysis of impedance is done.

  Channel Shortening Equalizers</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>12 pages, double column format, 5 figures</comments><msc-class>94A13</msc-class><abstract>  The problem of channel shortening equalization for optimal detection in ISI
channels is considered. The problem is to choose a linear equalizer and a
partial response target filter such that the combination produces the best
detection performance. Instead of using the traditional approach of MMSE
equalization, we directly seek all equalizer and target pairs that yield
optimal detection performance in terms of the sequence or symbol error rate.
This leads to a new notion of a posteriori equivalence between the equalized
and target channels with a simple characterization in terms of their underlying
probability distributions. Using this characterization we show the surprising
existence an infinite family of equalizer and target pairs for which any
maximum a posteriori (MAP) based detector designed for the target channel is
simultaneously MAP optimal for the equalized channel. For channels whose input
symbols have equal energy, such as q-PSK, the MMSE equalizer designed with a
monic target constraint yields a solution belonging to this optimal family of
designs. Although, these designs produce IIR target filters, the ideas are
extended to design good FIR targets. For an arbitrary choice of target and
equalizer, we derive an expression for the probability of sequence detection
error. This expression is used to design optimal FIR targets and IIR equalizers
and to quantify the FIR approximation penalty.

subset of wireless sensor networks (WSN) applications. As a result, the
performance of the WSN degrades significantly when misbehaving nodes report
false location and distance information in order to fake their actual location.
In this paper we propose a general distributed deterministic protocol for
accurate identification of faking sensors in a WSN. Our scheme does \emph{not}
rely on a subset of \emph{trusted} nodes that are not allowed to misbehave and
are known to every node in the network. Thus, any subset of nodes is allowed to
try faking its position. As in previous approaches, our protocol is based on
distance evaluation techniques developed for WSN. On the positive side, we show
that when the received signal strength (RSS) technique is used, our protocol
handles at most $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor-2$ faking sensors. Also, when the
time of flight (ToF) technique is used, our protocol manages at most $\lfloor
\frac{n}{2} \rfloor - 3$ misbehaving sensors. On the negative side, we prove
that no deterministic protocol can identify faking sensors if their number is
$\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil -1$. Thus our scheme is almost optimal with respect
to the number of faking sensors. We discuss application of our technique in the
trusted sensor model. More precisely our results can be used to minimize the
number of trusted sensors that are needed to defeat faking ones.

valuations of discrete lattice with some translational invariant constrains in
asymptotically optimal way. The method is based on finding statistical
description of such valuations and changing it into statistical algorithm,
which allows to construct deterministically valuation with given statistics.
Optimal statistics allow to generate valuations with uniform distribution - we
get maximum information capacity this way. It will be shown that we can reach
the optimum for one-dimensional models using maximal entropy random walk and
that for the general case we can practically get as close to the capacity of
the model as we want (found numerically: lost 10^{-10} bit/node for Hard
Square). There will be also presented simpler alternative to arithmetic coding
method which can be used as cryptosystem and data correction method too.

results regarding the performance of multicell processing and user cooperation
under the assumption of limited-capacity interbase station and inter-user

derived for non-fading uplink and downlink channels of simple cellular system

the insight into the limitations imposed by limited-capacity constraints on the
gains achievable by cooperative techniques.

algorithmic graph theory including transitive orientation, the recognition of
several classes of graphs, and certain combinatorial optimization problems.
Accordingly, there has been a drive towards a practical, linear-time algorithm
for the problem. Despite considerable effort, such an algorithm has remained
elusive. The linear-time algorithms to date are impractical and of mainly
theoretical interest. In this paper we present the first simple, linear-time
algorithm to compute the modular decomposition tree of an undirected graph. The
breakthrough comes by combining the best elements of two different approaches
to the problem.

in MPLS over Optical Transport Networks in terms of network resource usage and
configuration cost. We investigate two approaches to the survivability
deployment: single layer and multilayer survivability and present various
methods for spare capacity allocation (SCA) to reroute disrupted traffic. The
comparative analysis shows the influence of the traffic granularity on the
survivability cost: for high bandwidth LSPs, close to the optical channel
capacity, the multilayer survivability outperforms the single layer one,
whereas for low bandwidth LSPs the single layer survivability is more
cost-efficient. For the multilayer survivability we demonstrate that by mapping
efficiently the spare capacity of the MPLS layer onto the resources of the
optical layer one can achieve up to 22% savings in the total configuration cost
and up to 37% in the optical layer cost. Further savings (up to 9 %) in the
wavelength use can be obtained with the integrated approach to network
configuration over the sequential one, however, at the increase in the
optimization problem complexity. These results are based on a cost model with
actual technology pricing and were obtained for networks targeted to a
nationwide coverage.

The use of such technology however poses the problem of protection against
failures such as fibre cuts. One of the principal methods for link protection
used in optical WDM networks is pre-configured protection cycle (p-cycle). The
major problem of this method of protection resides in finding the optimal set
of p-cycles which protect the network for a given distribution of working
capacity. Existing heuristics generate a large set of p-cycle candidates which
are entirely independent of the network state, and from then the good sub-set
of p-cycles which will protect the network is selected. In this paper, we
propose a new algorithm of generation of p-cycles based on the incremental
aggregation of the shortest cycles. Our generation of p-cycles depends on the
state of the network. This enables us to choose an efficient set of p-cycles
which will protect the network. The set of p-cycles that we generate is the
final set which will protect the network, in other words our heuristic does not
go through the additional step of p-cycle selection

applications due to various reasons, e.g. robustness, fault tolerance, or
increased accuracy. At the same time high sensor redundancy offers the
possibility of increasing network lifetime by scheduling sleep intervals for
some sensors and still providing continuous service with help of the remaining
active sensors. In this paper centralized and distributed algorithms are
proposed to solve the k-coverage sensing problem and maximize network lifetime.
When physically possible, the proposed robust Controlled Greedy Sleep Algorithm
provides guaranteed service independently of node and communication errors in
the network. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated and compared to
results of a random solution by simulation examples.

problems. For example, experimental results show that {\em survey propagation}
(a certain message passing algorithm) is effective in finding proper
$k$-colorings of random graphs in the near-threshold regime. In 1962 Gallager
introduced the concept of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, and suggested
a simple decoding algorithm based on message passing. In 1994 Alon and Kahale
exhibited a coloring algorithm and proved its usefulness for finding a
$k$-coloring of graphs drawn from a certain planted-solution distribution over
$k$-colorable graphs. In this work we show an interpretation of Alon and
Kahale's coloring algorithm in light of Gallager's decoding algorithm, thus
showing a connection between the two problems - coloring and decoding. This
also provides a rigorous evidence for the usefulness of the message passing
paradigm for the graph coloring problem. Our techniques can be applied to
several other combinatorial optimization problems and networking-related
issues.

  with Multirate Capability under General Transmission Conditions</title><categories>cs.NI cs.PF</categories><comments>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, October
  21, 2007</comments><abstract>  The aim of this paper is threefold. First, it presents a multi-dimensional
Markovian state transition model characterizing the behavior of the IEEE 802.11
protocol at the Medium Access Control layer which accounts for packet
transmission failures due to channel errors modeling both saturated and
non-saturated traffic conditions. Second, it provides a throughput analysis of
the IEEE 802.11 protocol at the data link layer in both saturated and
non-saturated traffic conditions taking into account the impact of both the
physical propagation channel and multirate transmission in Rayleigh fading
environment. The general traffic model assumed is M/M/1/K. Finally, it shows
that the behavior of the throughput in non-saturated traffic conditions is a
linear combination of two system parameters; the payload size and the packet
rates, $\lambda^{(s)}$, of each contending station. The validity interval of
the proposed model is also derived.
  Simulation results closely match the theoretical derivations, confirming the
effectiveness of the proposed models.

  on Complex Systems, Boston, October 28 - November 2, 2007</comments><abstract>  It is a challenge to manage complex systems efficiently without confronting
NP-hard problems. To address the situation we suggest to use self-organization
processes of prime integer relations for information processing.
Self-organization processes of prime integer relations define correlation
structures of a complex system and can be equivalently represented by
transformations of two-dimensional geometrical patterns determining the
dynamics of the system and revealing its structural complexity. Computational
experiments raise the possibility of an optimality condition of complex systems
presenting the structural complexity of a system as a key to its optimization.
  From this perspective the optimization of a system could be all about the
control of the structural complexity of the system to make it consistent with
the structural complexity of the problem. The experiments also indicate that
the performance of a complex system may behave as a concave function of the
structural complexity. Therefore, once the structural complexity could be
controlled as a single entity, the optimization of a complex system would be
potentially reduced to a one-dimensional concave optimization irrespective of
the number of variables involved its description. This might open a way to a
new type of information processing for efficient management of complex systems.

[0,1] using N sensors deployed at regular intervals. The goal is to quantify
the total data rate required for the reconstruction of the field with a given
mean square distortion. We consider a class of two-stage mechanisms which a)
send information to allow the reconstruction of the sensor's samples within
sufficient accuracy, and then b) use these reconstructions to estimate the
entire field. To implement the first stage, the heavy correlation between the
sensor samples suggests the use of distributed coding schemes to reduce the
total rate. We demonstrate the existence of a distributed block coding scheme
that achieves, for a given fidelity criterion for the reconstruction of the
field, a total information rate that is bounded by a constant, independent of
the number $N$ of sensors. The constant in general depends on the
autocorrelation function of the field and the desired distortion criterion for
the sensor samples. We then describe a scheme which can be implemented using
only scalar quantizers at the sensors, without any use of distributed source
coding, and which also achieves a total information rate that is a constant,
independent of the number of sensors. While this scheme operates at a rate that
is greater than the rate achievable through distributed coding and entails
greater delay in reconstruction, its simplicity makes it attractive for
implementation in sensor networks.

Anonymization of network data for sharing sets up a fundamental tradeoff
between privacy protection versus security analysis capability. This
privacy/analysis tradeoff has been acknowledged by many researchers but this is
the first paper to provide empirical measurements to characterize the
privacy/analysis tradeoff for an enterprise dataset. Specifically we perform
anonymization options on single-fields within network packet traces and then
make measurements using intrusion detection system alarms as a proxy for
security analysis capability. Our results show: (1) two fields have a zero sum
tradeoff (more privacy lessens security analysis and vice versa) and (2) eight
fields have a more complex tradeoff (that is not zero sum) in which both
privacy and analysis can both be simultaneously accomplished.

channels is studied. The Taylor expansion of the coded modulation capacity for
generic signal constellations at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is derived and
used to determine the corresponding expansion for the BICM capacity. Simple
formulas for the minimum energy per bit and the wideband slope are given. BICM
is found to be suboptimal in the sense that its minimum energy per bit can be
larger than the corresponding value for coded modulation schemes. The minimum
energy per bit using standard Gray mapping on M-PAM or M^2-QAM is given by a
simple formula and shown to approach -0.34 dB as M increases. Using the low SNR
expansion, a general trade-off between power and bandwidth in the wideband
regime is used to show how a power loss can be traded off against a bandwidth
gain.

correlated MIMO Rician channels are determined. In this case, no closed-form
expressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are
available. An approximation of the average mutual information is evaluated in
this paper in the asymptotic regime where the number of transmit and receive
antennas converge to $+\infty$. New results related to the accuracy of the
corresponding large system approximation are provided. An attractive
optimization algorithm of this approximation is proposed and we establish that
it yields an effective way to compute the capacity achieving covariance matrix
for the average mutual information. Finally, numerical simulation results show
that, even for a moderate number of transmit and receive antennas, the new
approach provides the same results as direct maximization approaches of the
average mutual information, while being much more computationally attractive.

Specifically, we give an elementary and fairly short proof of the following

n, is asymptotic to log n as n tends to infinity. We also give finite-n bounds
refining the above limit. This result, originally proved by Chebyshev in 1852,
is closely related to the celebrated prime number theorem.

  Theory, Seattle, WA, July 2006</journal-ref><abstract>  We use statistical estimates of the entropy rate of spike train data in order
to make inferences about the underlying structure of the spike train itself. We
first examine a number of different parametric and nonparametric estimators
(some known and some new), including the ``plug-in'' method, several versions
of Lempel-Ziv-based compression algorithms, a maximum likelihood estimator
tailored to renewal processes, and the natural estimator derived from the
Context-Tree Weighting method (CTW). The theoretical properties of these
estimators are examined, several new theoretical results are developed, and all
estimators are systematically applied to various types of synthetic data and
under different conditions.
  Our main focus is on the performance of these entropy estimators on the
(binary) spike trains of 28 neurons recorded simultaneously for a one-hour
period from the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices of a monkey. We show
how the entropy estimates can be used to test for the existence of long-term
structure in the data, and we construct a hypothesis test for whether the
renewal process model is appropriate for these spike trains. Further, by
applying the CTW algorithm we derive the maximum a posterior (MAP) tree model
of our empirical data, and comment on the underlying structure it reveals.

long unlabeled audio streams to detect and locate audio clips provided by
users. The method involves feature-dimension reduction based on a piecewise
linear representation of a sequential feature trajectory extracted from a long
audio stream. Two techniques enable us to obtain a piecewise linear
representation: the dynamic segmentation of feature trajectories and the
segment-based Karhunen-L\'{o}eve (KL) transform. The proposed search method
guarantees the same search results as the search method without the proposed
feature-dimension reduction method in principle. Experiment results indicate
significant improvements in search speed. For example the proposed method
reduced the total search time to approximately 1/12 that of previous methods
and detected queries in approximately 0.3 seconds from a 200-hour audio
database.

function approximator more powerful than the MLP. This means that the
complexity of MLP would be prohibitively large for some problems while SRN
could realize the desired mapping with acceptable computational constraints.
The speed of training of complex recurrent networks is crucial to their
successful application. Present work improves the previous results by training
the network with extended Kalman filter (EKF). We implemented a generic
Cellular SRN and applied it for solving two challenging problems: 2D maze
navigation and a subset of the connectedness problem. The speed of convergence
has been improved by several orders of magnitude in comparison with the earlier
results in the case of maze navigation, and superior generalization has been
demonstrated in the case of connectedness. The implications of this
improvements are discussed.

hidden behind the terrorism disaster. It is to solve a node discovery problem,
which means to discover a node, which functions relevantly in a social network,
but escaped from monitoring on the presence and mutual relationship of nodes.
The method aims at integrating the expert investigator's prior understanding,
insight on the terrorists' social network nature derived from the complex graph
theory, and computational data processing. The social network responsible for
the 9/11 attack in 2001 is used to execute simulation experiment to evaluate
the performance of the method.

Inform. Theory</comments><acm-class>E.4</acm-class><abstract>  In their landmark paper Cover and El Gamal proposed different coding
strategies for the relay channel with a single relay supporting a communication
pair. These strategies are the decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward
approach, as well as a general lower bound on the capacity of a relay network
which relies on the mixed application of the previous two strategies. So far,
only parts of their work - the decode-and-forward and the compress-and-forward
strategy - have been applied to networks with multiple relays.
  This paper derives a mixed strategy for multiple relay networks using a
combined approach of partial decode-and-forward with N +1 levels and the ideas
of successive refinement with different side information at the receivers.
After describing the protocol structure, we present the achievable rates for
the discrete memoryless relay channel as well as Gaussian multiple relay
networks. Using these results we compare the mixed strategy with some special
cases, e. g., multilevel decode-and-forward, distributed compress-and-forward
and a mixed approach where one relay node operates in decode-and-forward and
the other in compress-and-forward mode.

  949-962</journal-ref><doi>10.1109/JSAC.2007.070608</doi><abstract>  In this paper we study different options for the survivability implementation
in MPLS over Optical Transport Networks (OTN) in terms of network resource
usage and configuration cost. We investigate two approaches to the
survivability deployment: single layer and multilayer survivability and present
various methods for spare capacity allocation (SCA) to reroute disrupted
traffic. The comparative analysis shows the influence of the offered traffic
granularity and the physical network structure on the survivability cost: for
high bandwidth LSPs, close to the optical channel capacity, the multilayer
survivability outperforms the single layer one, whereas for low bandwidth LSPs
the single layer survivability is more cost-efficient. On the other hand,
sparse networks of low connectivity parameter use more wavelengths for optical
path routing and increase the configuration cost, as compared with dense
networks. We demonstrate that by mapping efficiently the spare capacity of the
MPLS layer onto the resources of the optical layer one can achieve up to 22%
savings in the total configuration cost and up to 37% in the optical layer
cost. Further savings (up to 9 %) in the wavelength use can be obtained with
the integrated approach to network configuration over the sequential one,
however, at the increase in the optimization problem complexity. These results
are based on a cost model with different cost variations, and were obtained for
networks targeted to a nationwide coverage.

number of satisfying assignments of a Boolean CSP instance. Such problems are
parameterised by a constraint language specifying the relations that may be
used in constraints. If every relation in the constraint language is affine
then the number of satisfying assignments can be exactly counted in polynomial
time. Otherwise, if every relation in the constraint language is in the
co-clone IM_2 from Post's lattice, then the problem of counting satisfying
assignments is complete with respect to approximation-preserving reductions in
the complexity class #RH\Pi_1. This means that the problem of approximately
counting satisfying assignments of such a CSP instance is equivalent in
complexity to several other known counting problems, including the problem of
approximately counting the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph. For
every other fixed constraint language, the problem is complete for #P with
respect to approximation-preserving reductions, meaning that there is no fully
polynomial randomised approximation scheme for counting satisfying assignments
unless NP=RP.

Report RR-6331, Oct. 2007</report-no><journal-ref>Contemporary Mathematics 461 (2008) 47-58</journal-ref><abstract>  We give a new algorithm for performing the distinct-degree factorization of a
polynomial P(x) over GF(2), using a multi-level blocking strategy. The coarsest
level of blocking replaces GCD computations by multiplications, as suggested by
Pollard (1975), von zur Gathen and Shoup (1992), and others. The novelty of our
approach is that a finer level of blocking replaces multiplications by
squarings, which speeds up the computation in GF(2)[x]/P(x) of certain interval
polynomials when P(x) is sparse. As an application we give a fast algorithm to
search for all irreducible trinomials x^r + x^s + 1 of degree r over GF(2),
while producing a certificate that can be checked in less time than the full
search. Naive algorithms cost O(r^2) per trinomial, thus O(r^3) to search over
all trinomials of given degree r. Under a plausible assumption about the
distribution of factors of trinomials, the new algorithm has complexity O(r^2
(log r)^{3/2}(log log r)^{1/2}) for the search over all trinomials of degree r.
Our implementation achieves a speedup of greater than a factor of 560 over the
naive algorithm in the case r = 24036583 (a Mersenne exponent). Using our
program, we have found two new primitive trinomials of degree 24036583 over
GF(2) (the previous record degree was 6972593).

polynomial (square) system f. The algorithm performs O(n D kappa(f)) iterations
where n is the number of polynomials (as well as the dimension of the ambient
space), D is a bound on the polynomials' degree, and kappa(f) is a condition
number for the system. Each iteration uses an exponential number of operations.
The algorithm uses finite-precision arithmetic and a polynomial bound for the
precision required to ensure the returned output is correct is exhibited. This
bound is a major feature of our algorithm since it is in contrast with the
exponential precision required by the existing (symbolic) algorithms for
counting real zeros. The algorithm parallelizes well in the sense that each
iteration can be computed in parallel polynomial time with an exponential
number of processors.

strongly on their position in the word. The first letters are usually the least
easy to predict. This agrees with the intuitive notion that words are well
defined subunits in written languages, with much weaker correlations across
these units than within them. It implies that the average entropy of a letter
deep inside a word is roughly 4 times smaller than the entropy of the first
letter.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><doi>10.1109/DATE.2005.276</doi><abstract>  Current algorithms for bounded model checking use SAT methods for checking
satisfiability of Boolean formulae. These methods suffer from the potential
memory explosion problem. Methods based on the validity of Quantified Boolean
Formulae (QBF) allow an exponentially more succinct representation of formulae
to be checked, because no &quot;unrolling&quot; of the transition relation is required.
These methods have not been widely used, because of the lack of an efficient
decision procedure for QBF. We evaluate the usage of QBF in bounded model
checking (BMC), using general-purpose SAT and QBF solvers. We develop a
special-purpose decision procedure for QBF used in BMC, and compare our
technique with the methods using general-purpose SAT and QBF solvers on
real-life industrial benchmarks.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper presents a method to automatically generate compact symbolic
performance models of analog circuits with no prior specification of an
equation template. The approach takes SPICE simulation data as input, which
enables modeling of any nonlinear circuits and circuit characteristics. Genetic
programming is applied as a means of traversing the space of possible symbolic
expressions. A grammar is specially designed to constrain the search to a
canonical form for functions. Novel evolutionary search operators are designed
to exploit the structure of the grammar. The approach generates a set of
symbolic models which collectively provide a tradeoff between error and model
complexity. Experimental results show that the symbolic models generated are
compact and easy to understand, making this an effective method for aiding
understanding in analog design. The models also demonstrate better prediction
quality than posynomials.

technology's scaling limitations. However, many such devices exhibit

negative differential resistance (NDR) problem and the chaotic performance.
This paper proposes a new circuit simulation approach that can effectively
simulate nanotechnology devices with uncertain input sources and negative

times speedup comparing with existing simulators.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  We investigate a new fault ordering heuristic for test generation in
full-scan circuits. The heuristic is referred to as the accidental detection
index. It associates a value ADI (f) with every circuit fault f. The heuristic
estimates the number of faults that will be detected by a test generated for f.
Fault ordering is done such that a fault with a higher accidental detection
index appears earlier in the ordered fault set and targeted earlier during test
generation. This order is effective for generating compact test sets, and for
obtaining a test set with a steep fault coverage curve. Such a test set has
several applications. We present experimental results to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the heuristic.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  In today's embedded applications a significant portion of energy is spent in
the memory subsystem. Several approaches have been proposed to minimize this
energy, including the use of scratch pad memories, with many based on static
analysis of a program. However, often it is not possible to perform static
analysis and optimization of a program's memory access behavior unless the
program is specifically written for this purpose. In this paper we introduce
the FORAY model of a program that permits aggressive analysis of the
application's memory behavior that further enables such optimizations since it
consists of 'for' loops and array accesses which are easily analyzable. We
present FORAY-GEN: an automated profile-based approach for extraction of the
FORAY model from the original program. We also demonstrate how FORAY-GEN
enhances applicability of other memory subsystem optimization approaches,
resulting in an average of two times increase in the number of memory
references that can be analyzed by existing static approaches.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><doi>10.1109/DATE.2005.211</doi><abstract>  A technique based on the sensitivity of the output to input waveform is
presented for accurate propagation of delay information through a gate for the
purpose of static timing analysis (STA) in the presence of noise. Conventional
STA tools represent a waveform by its arrival time and slope. However, this is
not an accurate way of modeling the waveform for the purpose of noise analysis.
The key contribution of our work is the development of a method that allows
efficient propagation of equivalent waveforms throughout the circuit.
Experimental results demonstrate higher accuracy of the proposed
sensitivity-based gate delay propagation technique, SGDP, compared to the best
of existing approaches. SGDP is compatible with the current level of gate
characterization in conventional ASIC cell libraries, and as a result, it can
be easily incorporated into commercial STA tools to improve their accuracy.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><doi>10.1109/DATE.2005.166</doi><abstract>  Detailed modeling of processors and high performance cycle-accurate
simulators are essential for today's hardware and software design. These
problems are challenging enough by themselves and have seen many previous
research efforts. Addressing both simultaneously is even more challenging, with
many existing approaches focusing on one over another. In this paper, we
propose the Reduced Colored Petri Net (RCPN) model that has two advantages:
first, it offers a very simple and intuitive way of modeling pipelined
processors; second, it can generate high performance cycle-accurate simulators.
RCPN benefits from all the useful features of Colored Petri Nets without
suffering from their exponential growth in complexity. RCPN processor models
are very intuitive since they are a mirror image of the processor pipeline
block diagram. Furthermore, in our experiments on the generated cycle-accurate
simulators for XScale and StrongArm processor models, we achieved an order of
magnitude (~15 times) speedup over the popular SimpleScalar ARM simulator.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  In this paper, the application of a cycle accurate binary translator for
rapid prototyping of SoCs will be presented. This translator generates code to
run on a rapid prototyping system consisting of a VLIW processor and FPGAs. The
generated code is annotated with information that triggers cycle generation for
the hardware in parallel to the execution of the translated program. The VLIW
processor executes the translated program whereas the FPGAs contain the
hardware for the parallel cycle generation and the bus interface that adapts
the bus of the VLIW processor to the SoC bus of the emulated processor core.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  In this paper, we investigate the impact of interconnect and device process
variations on voltage fluctuations in power grids. We consider random
variations in the power grid's electrical parameters as spatial stochastic
processes and propose a new and efficient method to compute the stochastic
voltage response of the power grid. Our approach provides an explicit
analytical representation of the stochastic voltage response using orthogonal
polynomials in a Hilbert space. The approach has been implemented in a
prototype software called OPERA (Orthogonal Polynomial Expansions for Response
Analysis). Use of OPERA on industrial power grids demonstrated speed-ups of up
to two orders of magnitude. The results also show a significant variation of
about $\pm$ 35% in the nominal voltage drops at various nodes of the power
grids and demonstrate the need for variation-aware power grid analysis.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Utilizing on-chip caches in embedded multiprocessor-system-on-a-chip (MPSoC)
based systems is critical from both performance and power perspectives. While
most of the prior work that targets at optimizing cache behavior are performed
at hardware and compilation levels, operating system (OS) can also play major
role as it sees the global access pattern information across applications. This
paper proposes a cache-conscious OS process scheduling strategy based on data
reuse. The proposed scheduler implements two complementary approaches. First,
the processes that do not share any data between them are scheduled at
different cores if it is possible to do so. Second, the processes that could
not be executed at the same time (due to dependences) but share data among each
other are mapped to the same processor core so that they share the cache
contents. Our experimental results using this new data locality aware OS
scheduling strategy are promising, and show significant improvements in task
completion times.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Power dissipation during test is a major challenge in testing integrated
circuits. Dynamic power has been the dominant part of power dissipation in CMOS
circuits, however, in future technologies the static portion of power
dissipation will outreach the dynamic portion. This paper proposes an efficient
technique to reduce both dynamic and static power dissipation in scan
structures. Scan cell outputs which are not on the critical path(s) are
multiplexed to fixed values during scan mode. These constant values and primary
inputs are selected such that the transitions occurred on non-multiplexed scan
cells are suppressed and the leakage current during scan mode is decreased. A
method for finding these vectors is also proposed. Effectiveness of this
technique is proved by experiments performed on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Assessing IC manufacturing process fluctuations and their impacts on IC
interconnect performance has become unavoidable for modern DSM designs.
However, the construction of parametric interconnect models is often hampered
by the rapid increase in computational cost and model complexity. In this paper
we present an efficient yet accurate parametric model order reduction algorithm
for addressing the variability of IC interconnect performance. The efficiency
of the approach lies in a novel combination of low-rank matrix approximation
and multi-parameter moment matching. The complexity of the proposed parametric
model order reduction is as low as that of a standard Krylov subspace method
when applied to a nominal system. Under the projection-based framework, our
algorithm also preserves the passivity of the resulting parametric models.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper proposes a diagnosis scheme aimed at reducing diagnosis time of
distributed small embedded SRAMs (e-SRAMs). This scheme improves the one
proposed in [A parallel built-in self-diagnostic method for embedded memory
buffers, A parallel built-in self-diagnostic method for embedded memory
arrays]. The improvements are mainly two-fold. On one hand, the diagnosis of
time-consuming Data Retention Faults (DRFs), which is neglected by the
diagnosis architecture in [A parallel built-in self-diagnostic method for
embedded memory buffers, A parallel built-in self-diagnostic method for
embedded memory arrays], is now considered and performed via a DFT technique
referred to as the &quot;No Write Recovery Test Mode (NWRTM)&quot;. On the other hand, a
pair comprising a Serial to Parallel Converter (SPC) and a Parallel to Serial
Converter (PSC) is utilized to replace the bi-directional serial interface, to
avoid the problems of serial fault masking and defect rate dependent diagnosis.
Results from our evaluations show that the proposed diagnosis scheme achieves
an increased diagnosis coverage and reduces diagnosis time compared to those
obtained in [A parallel built-in self-diagnostic method for embedded memory
buffers, A parallel built-in self-diagnostic method for embedded memory
arrays], with neglectable extra area cost.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The memory subsystem has always been a bottleneck in performance as well as
significant power contributor in memory intensive applications. Many
researchers have presented multi-layered memory hierarchies as a means to
design energy and performance efficient systems. However, most of the previous
work do not explore trade-offs systematically. We fill this gap by proposing a
formalized technique that takes into consideration data reuse, limited lifetime
of the arrays of an application and application specific prefetching
opportunities, and performs a thorough trade-off exploration for different
memory layer sizes. This technique has been implemented on a prototype tool,
which was tested successfully using nine real-life applications of industrial
relevance. Following this approach we have able to reduce execution time up to
60%, and energy consumption up to 70%.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Conventional cache models are not suited for real-time parallel processing
because tasks may flush each other's data out of the cache in an unpredictable
manner. In this way the system is not compositional so the overall performance
is difficult to predict and the integration of new tasks expensive. This paper
proposes a new method that imposes compositionality to the system?s performance
and makes different memory hierarchy optimizations possible for multimedia
communicating tasks when running on embedded multiprocessor architectures. The
method is based on a cache allocation strategy that assigns sets of the unified
cache exclusively to tasks and to the communication buffers. We also
analytically formulate the problem and describe a method to compute the cache
partitioning ratio for optimizing the throughput and the consumed power. When
applied to a multiprocessor with memory hierarchy our technique delivers also
performance gain. Compared to the shared cache case, for an application
consisting of two jpeg decoders and one edge detection algorithm 5 times less
misses are experienced and for an mpeg2 decoder 6.5 times less misses are
experienced.

and cost of the embedded system. This paper proposes a thermal-aware task
allocation and scheduling algorithm for embedded systems. The algorithm is used
as a sub-routine for hardware/software co-synthesis to reduce the peak
temperature and achieve a thermally even distribution while meeting real time
constraints. The paper investigates both power-aware and thermal-aware
approaches to task allocation and scheduling. The experimental results show
that the thermal-aware approach outperforms the power-aware schemes in terms of
maximal and average temperature reductions. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first task allocation and scheduling algorithm that takes temperature

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  As feature sizes shrink, it will be necessary to use AAPSM
(Alternating-Aperture Phase Shift Masking) to image critical features,
especially on the polysilicon layer. This imposes additional constraints on the
layouts beyond traditional design rules. Of particular note is the requirement
that all critical features be flanked by opposite-phase shifters, while the
shifters obey minimum width and spacing requirements. A layout is called
phase-assignable if it satisfies this requirement. If a layout is not
phase-assignable, the phase conflicts have to removed to enable the use of
AAPSM for the layout. Previous work has sought to detect a suitable set of
phase Conflicts to be removed, as well as correct them. The contribution of
this paper are the following: (1) a new approach to detect a minimal set of
phase conflicts (also referred to as AAPSM conflicts), which when corrected
will produce a phase-assignable layout; (2) a novel layout modification scheme
for correcting these AAPSM conflicts. The proposed approach for conflict
detection shows significant improvements in the quality of results and runtime
for real industrial circuits, when compared to previous methods. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time layout modification results are presented
for bright-field AAPSM. Our experiments show that the percentage area increase
for making a layout phase-assignable ranges from 0.7-11.8%.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Operating frequency of a pipelined circuit is determined by the delay of the
slowest pipeline stage. However, under statistical delay variation in sub-100nm
technology regime, the slowest stage is not readily identifiable and the
estimation of the pipeline yield with respect to a target delay is a
challenging problem. We have proposed analytical models to estimate yield for a
pipelined design based on delay distributions of individual pipe stages. Using
the proposed models, we have shown that change in logic depth and imbalance
between the stage delays can improve the yield of a pipeline. A statistical
methodology has been developed to optimally design a pipeline circuit for
enhancing yield. Optimization results show that, proper imbalance among the
stage delays in a pipeline improves design yield by 9% for the same area and
performance (and area reduction by about 8.4% under a yield constraint) over a
balanced design.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Application of Microelectronic to bioanalysis is an emerging field which
holds great promise. From the standpoint of electronic and system design,
biochips imply a radical change of perspective, since new, completely different
constraints emerge while other usual constraints can be relaxed. While
electronic parts of the system can rely on the usual established design-flow,
fluidic and packaging design, calls for a new approach which relies
significantly on experiments. We hereby make some general considerations based
on our experience in the development of biochips for cell analysis.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  We describe verification techniques for embedded memory systems using
efficient memory modeling (EMM), without explicitly modeling each memory bit.
We extend our previously proposed approach of EMM in Bounded Model Checking
(BMC) for a single read/write port single memory system, to more commonly
occurring systems with multiple memories, having multiple read and write ports.
More importantly, we augment such EMM to providing correctness proofs, in
addition to finding real bugs as before. The novelties of our verification
approach are in a) combining EMM with proof-based abstraction that preserves
the correctness of a property up to a certain analysis depth of SAT-based BMC,
and b) modeling arbitrary initial memory state precisely and thereby, providing
inductive proofs using SAT-based BMC for embedded memory systems. Similar to
the previous approach, we construct a verification model by eliminating memory
arrays, but retaining the memory interface signals with their control logic and
adding constraints on those signals at every analysis depth to preserve the
data forwarding semantics. The size of these EMM constraints depends
quadratically on the number of memory accesses and the number of read and write
ports; and linearly on the address and data widths and the number of memories.
We show the effectiveness of our approach on several industry designs and
software programs.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  As the communication requirements of current and future Multiprocessor
Systems on Chips (MPSoCs) continue to increase, scalable communication
architectures are needed to support the heavy communication demands of the
system. This is reflected in the recent trend that many of the standard bus
products such as STbus, have now introduced the capability of designing a
crossbar with multiple buses operating in parallel. The crossbar configuration
should be designed to closely match the application traffic characteristics and
performance requirements. In this work we address this issue of
application-specific design of optimal crossbar (using STbus crossbar
architecture), satisfying the performance requirements of the application and
optimal binding of cores onto the crossbar resources. We present a simulation
based design approach that is based on analysis of actual traffic trace of the
application, considering local variations in traffic rates, temporal overlap
among traffic streams and criticality of traffic streams. Our methodology is
applied to several MPSoC designs and the resulting crossbar platforms are
validated for performance by cycle-accurate SystemC simulation of the designs.
The experimental case studies show large reduction in packet latencies (up to
7x) and large crossbar component savings (up to 3.5x) compared to traditional
design approaches.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Microfluidics-based biochips are soon expected to revolutionize clinical
diagnosis, DNA sequencing, and other laboratory procedures involving molecular
biology. Most microfluidic biochips are based on the principle of continuous
fluid flow and they rely on permanently-etched microchannels, micropumps, and
microvalves. We focus here on the automated design of &quot;digital&quot; droplet-based
microfluidic biochips. In contrast to continuous-flow systems, digital
microfluidics offers dynamic reconfigurability; groups of cells in a
microfluidics array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during
the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. We present a simulated
annealing-based technique for module placement in such biochips. The placement
procedure not only addresses chip area, but it also considers fault tolerance,
which allows a microfluidic module to be relocated elsewhere in the system when
a single cell is detected to be faulty. Simulation results are presented for a
case study involving the polymerase chain reaction.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  On-chip buses are typically designed to meet performance constraints at
worst-case conditions, including process corner, temperature, IR-drop, and
neighboring net switching pattern. This can result in significant performance
slack at more typical operating conditions. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
voltage scaling (DVS) technique for buses, based on a double sampling latch
which can detect and correct for delay errors without the need for
retransmission. The proposed approach recovers the available slack at
non-worst-case operating points through more aggressive voltage scaling and
tracks changing conditions by monitoring the error recovery rate. Voltage
margins needed in traditional designs to accommodate worst-case performance
conditions are therefore eliminated, resulting in a significant improvement in
energy efficiency. The approach was implemented for a 6mm memory read bus
operating at 1.5GHz (0.13 $\mu$m technology node) and was simulated for a
number of benchmark programs. Even at the worst-case process and environment
conditions, energy gains of up to 17% are achieved, with error recovery rates
under 2.3%. At more typical process and environment conditions, energy gains
range from 35% to 45%, with a performance degradation under 2%. An analysis of
optimum interconnect architectures for maximizing energy gains with this
approach shows that the proposed approach performs well with technology
scaling.

nanoscale design is addressed via a complexity theory-based approach. This
paper provides a theoretical framework that is able to assess the trade-offs
existing in nanoscale designs between the amount of redundancy needed for a
given level of resilience to errors and the associated energy cost. Circuit
size, logic depth and error resilience are analyzed and brought together in a
theoretical framework that can be seamlessly integrated with automated
synthesis tools and can guide the design process of nanoscale systems comprised
of failure prone devices. The impact of redundancy addition on the switching
energy and its relationship with leakage energy is modeled in detail. Results
show that 99% error resilience is possible for fault-tolerant designs, but at
the expense of at least 40% more energy if individual gates fail independently
with probability of 1%.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  As Moore's Law continues to fuel the ability to build ever increasingly
complex system-on-chips (SoCs), achieving performance goals is rising as a
critical challenge to completing designs. In particular, the system
interconnect must efficiently service a diverse set of data flows with widely
ranging quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. However, the known solutions for
off-chip interconnects such as large-scale networks are not necessarily
applicable to the on-chip environment. Latency and memory constraints for
on-chip interconnects are quite different from larger-scale interconnects. This
paper introduces a novel on-chip interconnect arbitration scheme. We show how
this scheme can be distributed across a chip for high-speed implementation. We
compare the performance of the arbitration scheme with other known interconnect
arbitration schemes. Existing schemes typically focus heavily on either low
latency of service for some initiators, or alternatively on guaranteed
bandwidth delivery for other initiators. Our scheme allows service latency on
some initiators to be traded off smoothly against jitter bounds on other
initiators, while still delivering bandwidth guarantees. This scheme is a
subset of the QoS controls that are available in the SonicsMX? (SMX) product.

challenges: concurrency and timing control.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Importance of addressing soft errors in both safety critical applications and
commercial consumer products is increasing, mainly due to ever shrinking
geometries, higher-density circuits, and employment of power-saving techniques
such as voltage scaling and component shut-down. As a result, it is becoming
necessary to treat reliability as a first-class citizen in system design. In
particular, reliability decisions taken early in system design can have
significant benefits in terms of design quality. Motivated by this observation,
this paper presents a reliability-centric high-level synthesis approach that
addresses the soft error problem. The proposed approach tries to maximize
reliability of the design while observing the bounds on area and performance,
and makes use of our reliability characterization of hardware components such
as adders and multipliers. We implemented the proposed approach, performed
experiments with several designs, and compared the results with those obtained
by a prior proposal.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The design of reliable circuits has received a lot of attention in the past,
leading to the definition of several design techniques introducing fault
detection and fault tolerance properties in systems for critical
applications/environments. Such design methodologies tackled the problem at
different abstraction levels, from switch-level to logic, RT level, and more
recently to system level. Aim of this paper is to introduce a novel
system-level technique based on the redefinition of the operators functionality
in the system specification. This technique provides reliability properties to
the system data path, transparently with respect to the designer. Feasibility,
fault coverage, performance degradation and overheads are investigated on a FIR
circuit.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Many SOCs today contain both digital and analog embedded cores. Even though
the test cost for such mixed-signal SOCs is significantly higher than that for
digital SOCs, most prior research in this area has focused exclusively on
digital cores. We propose a low-cost test development methodology for
mixed-signal SOCs that allows the analog and digital cores to be tested in a
unified manner, thereby minimizing the overall test cost. The analog cores in
the SOC are wrapped such that they can be accessed using a digital test access
mechanism (TAM). We evaluate the impact of the use of analog test wrappers on
area overhead and test time. To reduce area overhead, we present an analog test
wrapper optimization technique, which is then combined with TAM optimization in
a cost-oriented heuristic approach for test scheduling. We also demonstrate the
feasibility of using analog wrappers by presenting transistor-level simulations
for an analog wrapper and a representative core. We present experimental
results on test scheduling for an ITC'02 benchmark SOC that has been augmented
with five analog cores.

and reduce test costs. We present a test throughput model, in which we focus on

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is a suitable fault tolerant technique for
SRAM-based FPGA. However, one of the main challenges in achieving 100%
robustness in designs protected by TMR running on programmable platforms is to
prevent upsets in the routing from provoking undesirable connections between
signals from distinct redundant logic parts, which can generate an error in the
output. This paper investigates the optimal design of the TMR logic (e.g., by
cleverly inserting voters) to ensure robustness. Four different versions of a
TMR digital filter were analyzed by fault injection. Faults were randomly
inserted straight into the bitstream of the FPGA. The experimental results
presented in this paper demonstrate that the number and placement of voters in
the TMR design can directly affect the fault tolerance, ranging from 4.03% to
0.98% the number of upsets in the routing able to cause an error in the TMR
circuit.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Development of energy and performance-efficient embedded software is
increasingly relying on application of complex transformations on the critical
parts of the source code. Designers applying such nontrivial source code
transformations are often faced with the problem of ensuring functional
equivalence of the original and transformed programs. Currently they have to
rely on incomplete and time-consuming simulation. Formal automatic verification
of the transformed program against the original is instead desirable. This
calls for equivalence checking tools similar to the ones available for
comparing digital circuits. We present such a tool to compare array-intensive
programs related through a combination of important global transformations like
expression propagations, loop and algebraic transformations. When the
transformed program fails to pass the equivalence check, the tool provides
specific feedback on the possible locations of errors.

of an analytical solver and a dynamic programming based method. Specifically,
the analytical solver chooses a concise repeater library and a small set of
repeater location candidates such that the dynamic programming algorithm can be
performed fast with little degradation of the solution quality. In comparison
with previously reported repeater insertion schemes, within comparable
runtimes, our approach achieves up to 37% higher power savings. Moreover, for
the same design quality, our scheme attains a speedup of two orders of
magnitude.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Buffer insertion is a popular technique to reduce the interconnect delay. The
classic buffer insertion algorithm of van Ginneken has time complexity O(n^2),
where n is the number of buffer positions. Lillis, Cheng and Lin extended van
Ginneken's algorithm to allow b buffer types in time O (b^2 n^2). For modern
design libraries that contain hundreds of buffers, it is a serious challenge to
balance the speed and performance of the buffer insertion algorithm. In this
paper, we present a new algorithm that computes the optimal buffer insertion in
O (bn^2) time. The reduction is achieved by the observation that the (Q, C)
pairs of the candidates that generate the new candidates must form a convex
hull. On industrial test cases, the new algorithm is faster than the previous
best buffer insertion algorithms by orders of magnitude.

The monolithic integrated readout allows for a high signal-to-noise ratio,
lowers the sensitivity to external interference and enables autonomous device

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper presents the effectiveness of various stress conditions (mainly
voltage and frequency) on detecting the resistive shorts and open defects in
deep sub-micron embedded memories in an industrial environment. Simulation
studies on very-low voltage, high voltage and at-speed testing show the need of
the stress conditions for high quality products; i.e., low defect-per-million
(DPM) level, which is driving the semiconductor market today. The above test
conditions have been validated to screen out bad devices on real silicon (a
test-chip) built on CMOS 0.18 um technology. IFA (inductive fault analysis)
based simulation technique leads to an efficient fault coverage and DPM
estimator, which helps the customers upfront to make decisions on test
algorithm implementations under different stress conditions in order to reduce
the number of test escapes.

us to utilize group theory to exploit the properties of the synthesis problem.
Assuming a cost of one for each two-qubit gate, we found all reversible

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper describes an improved approach to Boolean network optimization
using internal don't-cares. The improvements concern the type of don't-cares
computed, their scope, and the computation method. Instead of the traditionally
used compatible observability don't-cares (CODCs), we introduce and justify the
use of complete don't-cares (CDC). To ensure the robustness of the don't-care
computation for very large industrial networks, a optional windowing scheme is
implemented that computes substantial subsets of the CDCs in reasonable time.
Finally, we give a SAT-based don't-care computation algorithm that is more
efficient than BDD-based algorithms. Experimental results confirm that these
improvements work well in practice. Complete don't-cares allow for a reduction
in the number of literals compared to the CODCs. Windowing guarantees
robustness, even for very large benchmarks on which previous methods could not
be applied. SAT reduces the runtime and enhances robustness, making don't-cares
affordable for a variety of other Boolean methods applied to the network.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The increased dominance of intra-die process variations has motivated the
field of Statistical Static Timing Analysis (SSTA) and has raised the need for
SSTA-based circuit optimization. In this paper, we propose a new sensitivity
based, statistical gate sizing method. Since brute-force computation of the
change in circuit delay distribution to gate size change is computationally
expensive, we propose an efficient and exact pruning algorithm. The pruning
algorithm is based on a novel theory of perturbation bounds which are shown to
decrease as they propagate through the circuit. This allows pruning of gate
sensitivities without complete propagation of their perturbations. We apply our
proposed optimization algorithm to ISCAS benchmark circuits and demonstrate the
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Our results show an improvement
of up to 10.5% in the 99-percentile circuit delay for the same circuit area,
using the proposed statistical optimizer and a run time improvement of up to
56x compared to the brute-force approach.

to synthesize assertion monitors from visual specifications given in CESC

monitor synthesis algorithm.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  In this paper, we present a software compilation approach for
microprocessor/FPGA platforms that partitions a software binary onto custom
hardware implemented in the FPGA. Our approach imposes less restrictions on
software tool flow than previous compiler approaches, allowing software
designers to use any software language and compiler. Our approach uses a
back-end partitioning tool that utilizes decompilation techniques to recover
important high-level information, resulting in performance comparable to
high-level compiler-based approaches.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper presents a scheme for efficient channel usage between simulator
and accelerator where the accelerator models some RTL sub-blocks in the
accelerator-based hardware/software co-simulation while the simulator runs
transaction-level model of the remaining part of the whole chip being verified.
With conventional simulation accelerator, evaluations of simulator and
accelerator alternate at every valid simulation time, which results in poor
simulation performance due to startup overhead of simulator-accelerator channel
access. The startup overhead can be reduced by merging multiple transactions on
the channel into a single burst traffic. We propose a predictive packetizing
scheme for reducing channel traffic by merging as many transactions into a
burst traffic as possible based on 'prediction and rollback.' Under ideal
condition with 100% prediction accuracy, the proposed method shows a
performance gain of 1500% compared to the conventional one.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The aggressive application of scalar replacement to array references
substantially reduces the number of memory operations at the expense of a
possibly very large number of registers. In this paper we describe a register
allocation algorithm that assigns registers to scalar replaced array references
along the critical paths of a computation, in many cases exploiting the
opportunity for concurrent memory accesses. Experimental results, for a set of
image/signal processing code kernels, reveal that the proposed algorithm leads
to a substantial reduction of the number of execution cycles for the
corresponding hardware implementation on a contemporary
Field-Programmable-Gate-Array (FPGA) when compared to other greedy allocation
algorithms, in some cases, using even fewer number of registers.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper presents a technique for eliminating redundant cache-tag and
cache-way accesses to reduce power consumption. The basic idea is to keep a
small number of Most Recently Used (MRU) addresses in a Memory Address Buffer
(MAB) and to omit redundant tag and way accesses when there is a MAB-hit. Since
the approach keeps only tag and set-index values in the MAB, the energy and
area overheads are relatively small even for a MAB with a large number of
entries. Furthermore, the approach does not sacrifice the performance. In other
words, neither the cycle time nor the number of executed cycles increases. The
proposed technique has been applied to Fujitsu VLIW processor (FR-V) and its
power saving has been estimated using NanoSim. Experiments for 32kB 2-way set
associative caches show the power consumption of I-cache and D-cache can be
reduced by 40% and 50%, respectively.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures aim to achieve both goals of high
performance and flexibility. However, existing reconfigurable array
architectures require many resources without considering the specific
application domain. Functional resources that take long latency and/or large
area can be pipelined and/or shared among the processing elements. Therefore
the hardware cost and the delay can be effectively reduced without any
performance degradation for some application domains. We suggest such
reconfigurable array architecture template and design space exploration flow
for domain-specific optimization. Experimental results show that our approach
is much more efficient both in performance and area compared to existing
reconfigurable architectures.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provide designers with the ability to
quickly create hardware circuits. Increases in FPGA configurable logic capacity
and decreasing FPGA costs have enabled designers to more readily incorporate
FPGAs in their designs. FPGA vendors have begun providing configurable soft
processor cores that can be synthesized onto their FPGA products. While FPGAs
with soft processor cores provide designers with increased flexibility, such
processors typically have degraded performance and energy consumption compared
to hard-core processors. Previously, we proposed warp processing, a technique
capable of optimizing a software application by dynamically and transparently
re-implementing critical software kernels as custom circuits in on-chip
configurable logic. In this paper, we study the potential of a MicroBlaze
soft-core based warp processing system to eliminate the performance and energy
overhead of a soft-core processor compared to a hard-core processor. We
demonstrate that the soft-core based warp processor achieves average speedups
of 5.8 and energy reductions of 57% compared to the soft core alone. Our data
shows that a soft-core based warp processor yields performance and energy
consumption competitive with existing hard-core processors, thus expanding the
usefulness of soft processor cores on FPGAs to a broader range of applications.

architecture synthesis that matches the communication requirements of the
target application. This is an important problem, particularly for
network-based implementations of complex applications. Our approach is based on
using frequently encountered generic communication primitives as an alphabet
capable of characterizing any given communication pattern. The proposed
algorithm searches through the entire design space for a solution that
minimizes the system total energy consumption, while satisfying the other
design constraints. Compared to the standard mesh architecture, the customized

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  In this paper, a method is proposed for finding a pixel transformation
function that maximizes backlight dimming while maintaining a pre-specified
image distortion level for a liquid crystal display. This is achieved by
finding a pixel transformation function, which maps the original image
histogram to a new histogram with lower dynamic range. Next the contrast of the
transformed image is enhanced so as to compensate for brightness loss that
would arise from backlight dimming. The proposed approach relies on an accurate
definition of the image distortion which takes into account both the pixel
value differences and a model of the human visual system and is amenable to
highly efficient hardware realization. Experimental results show that the
histogram equalization for backlight scaling method results in about 45% power
saving with an effective distortion rate of 5% and 65% power saving for a 20%
distortion rate. This is significantly higher power savings compared to
previously reported backlight dimming approaches.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  A new approach for enhancing the process-variation tolerance of digital
circuits is described. We extend recent advances in statistical timing analysis
into an optimization framework. Our objective is to reduce the performance
variance of a technology-mapped circuit where delays across elements are
represented by random variables which capture the manufacturing variations. We
introduce the notion of statistical critical paths, which account for both
means and variances of performance variation. An optimization engine is used to
size gates with a goal of reducing the timing variance along the statistical
critical paths. We apply a pair of nested statistical analysis methods
deploying a slower more accurate approach for tracking statistical critical
paths and a fast engine for evaluation of gate size assignments. We derive a
new approximation for the max operation on random variables which is deployed
for the faster inner engine. Circuit optimization is carried out using a
gain-based algorithm that terminates when constraints are satisfied or no
further improvements can be made. We show optimization results that demonstrate
an average of 72% reduction in performance variation at the expense of average
20% increase in design area.

functionality, power dissipation is becoming one of the major design
considerations in the development of network processors. In this paper, we use
an assertion-based methodology for system-level power/performance analysis to
study two dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) techniques, traffic-based DVS and
execution-based DVS, in a network processor model. Using the automatically
generated distribution analyzers, we analyze the power and performance
distributions and study their trade-offs for the two DVS policies with
different parameter settings such as threshold values and window sizes. We
discuss the optimal configurations of the two DVS policies under different
design requirements. By a set of experiments, we show that the assertion-based
trace analysis methodology is an efficient tool that can help a designer easily
compare and study optimal architectural configurations in a large design space.

device failures due to gate oxide breakdown (OBD) also increases. To provide
designs that are tolerant to such failures, we must investigate and understand
the manifestations of this physical phenomenon at the circuit and system level.
In this paper, we develop a model for operational OBD defects, and we explore
how to test for faults due to OBD. For a NAND gate, we derive the necessary
input conditions that excite and detect errors due to OBD defects at the gate
level. We show that traditional pattern generators fail to exercise all of
these defects. Finally, we show that these test patterns can be propagated and
justified for a combinational circuit in a manner similar to traditional ATPG.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  FPGAs, as computing devices, offer significant speedup over microprocessors.
Furthermore, their configurability offers an advantage over traditional ASICs.
However, they do not yet enjoy high-level language programmability, as
microprocessors do. This has become the main obstacle for their wider
acceptance by application designers. ROCCC is a compiler designed to generate
circuits from C source code to execute on FPGAs, more specifically on CSoCs. It
generates RTL level HDLs from frequently executing kernels in an application.
In this paper, we describe ROCCC's system overview and focus on its data path
generation. We compare the performance of ROCCC-generated VHDL code with that
of Xilinx IPs. The synthesis result shows that ROCCC-generated circuit takes
around 2x ~ 3x area and runs at comparable clock rate.

  Circuit Synthesis</title><categories>cs.AR</categories><comments>Submitted on behalf of EDAA (http://www.edaa.com/)</comments><proxy>ccsd hal-00181507</proxy><journal-ref>Dans Design, Automation and Test in Europe - DATE'05, Munich :
  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper presents the novel idea of multi-placement structures, for a fast
and optimized placement instantiation in analog circuit synthesis. These
structures need to be generated only once for a specific circuit topology. When
used in synthesis, these pre-generated structures instantiate various layout
floorplans for various sizes and parameters of a circuit. Unlike procedural
layout generators, they enable fast placement of circuits while keeping the
quality of the placements at a high level during a synthesis process. The fast
placement is a result of high speed instantiation resulting from the efficiency
of the multi-placement structure. The good quality of placements derive from
the extensive and intelligent search process that is used to build the
multi-placement structure. The target benchmarks of these structures are analog
circuits in the vicinity of 25 modules. An algorithm for the generation of such
multi-placement structures is presented. Experimental results show placement
execution times with an average of a few milliseconds making them usable during
layout-aware synthesis for optimized placements.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Testing a non-digital integrated system against all of its specifications can
be quite expensive due to the elaborate test application and measurement setup
required. We propose to eliminate redundant tests by employing e-SVM based
statistical learning. Application of the proposed methodology to an operational
amplifier and a MEMS accelerometer reveal that redundant tests can be
statistically identified from a complete set of specification-based tests with
negligible error. Specifically, after eliminating five of eleven
specification-based tests for an operational amplifier, the defect escape and
yield loss is small at 0.6% and 0.9%, respectively. For the accelerometer,
defect escape of 0.2% and yield loss of 0.1% occurs when the hot and colt tests
are eliminated. For the accelerometer, this level of Compaction would reduce
test cost by more than half.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Nanometer circuits are becoming increasingly susceptible to soft-errors due
to alpha-particle and atmospheric neutron strikes as device scaling reduces
node capacitances and supply/threshold voltage scaling reduces noise margins.
It is becoming crucial to add soft-error tolerance estimation and optimization
to the design flow to handle the increasing susceptibility. The first part of
this paper presents a tool for accurate soft-error tolerance analysis of
nanometer circuits (ASERTA) that can be used to estimate the soft-error
tolerance of nanometer circuits consisting of millions of gates. The tolerance
estimates generated by the tool match SPICE generated estimates closely while
taking orders of magnitude less computation time. The second part of the paper
presents a tool for soft-error tolerance optimization of nanometer circuits
(SERTOPT) using the tolerance estimates generated by ASERTA. The tool finds
optimal sizes, channel lengths, supply voltages and threshold voltages to be
assigned to gates in a combinational circuit such that the soft-error tolerance
is increased while meeting the timing constraint. Experiments on ISCAS'85
benchmark circuits showed that soft-error rate of the optimized circuit
decreased by as much as 47% with marginal increase in circuit delay.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper reports a novel simulation methodology for analysis and prediction
of substrate noise impact on analog / RF circuits taking into account the role
of the parasitic resistance of the on-chip interconnect in the impact
mechanism. This methodology allows investigation of the role of the separate
devices (also parasitic devices) in the analog / RF circuit in the overall
impact. This way is revealed which devices have to be taken care of (shielding,
topology change) to protect the circuit against substrate noise. The developed
methodology is used to analyze impact of substrate noise on a 3 GHz LC-tank
Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) designed in a high-ohmic 0.18 $\mu$m 1PM6
CMOS technology. For this VCO (in the investigated frequency range from DC to
15 MHz) impact is mainly caused by resistive coupling of noise from the
substrate to the non-ideal on-chip ground interconnect, resulting in analog
ground bounce and frequency modulation. Hence, the presented test-case reveals
the important role of the on-chip interconnect in the phenomenon of substrate
noise impact.

estimate the achievable bit error rate in presence of phase and frequency

extensive verification of the topology. Thermal noise modeling based on

currently unfeasible. Due to the wearability concerns, low-power techniques are
critical for e-textile applications. In this paper, we address the issue of the
energy-aware routing for e-textile platforms and propose an efficient algorithm
to solve it. The platform we consider consists of dedicated components for
e-textiles, including computational modules, dedicated transmission lines and
thin-film batteries on fiber substrates. Furthermore, we derive an analytical

percent of this analytical upper bound. Moreover, compared to the
non-energy-aware counterpart, our routing technique increases the number of
encryption jobs completed by one order of magnitude.

the gate and the reverse biased junction band-to-band-tunneling (BTBT) leakage,
results in the large increase of total leakage power in a logic circuit.
Leakage components interact with each other in device level (through device
geometry, doping profile) and also in the circuit level (through node
voltages). Due to the circuit level interaction of the different leakage
components, the leakage of a logic gate strongly depends on the circuit
topology i.e. number and nature of the other logic gates connected to its input

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Wireless microsensor networks, which have been the topic of intensive
research in recent years, are now emerging in industrial applications. An
important milestone in this transition has been the release of the IEEE
802.15.4 standard that specifies interoperable wireless physical and medium
access control layers targeted to sensor node radios. In this paper, we
evaluate the potential of an 802.15.4 radio for use in an ultra low power
sensor node operating in a dense network. Starting from measurements carried
out on the off-the-shelf radio, effective radio activation and link adaptation
policies are derived. It is shown that, in a typical sensor network scenario,
the average power per node can be reduced down to 211m mm mW. Next, the energy
consumption breakdown between the different phases of a packet transmission is
presented, indicating which part of the transceiver architecture can most
effectively be optimized in order to further reduce the radio power, enabling
self-powered wireless microsensor networks.

for thermal monitoring of standard-cell based VLSI circuits. The proposed smart
temperature sensor uses a ring-oscillator composed of complex gates instead of

when an adequate set of standard logic gates is selected.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Characterization of semiconductor devices is used to gather as much data
about the device as possible to determine weaknesses in design or trends in the
manufacturing process. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple trip point
characterization concept to overcome the constraint of single trip point
concept in device characterization phase. In addition, we use computational
intelligence techniques (e.g. neural network, fuzzy and genetic algorithm) to
further manipulate these sets of multiple trip point values and tests based on
semiconductor test equipments, Our experimental results demonstrate an
excellent design parameter variation analysis in device characterization phase,
as well as detection of a set of worst case tests that can provoke the worst
case variation, while traditional approach was not capable of detecting them.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Test sets that detect each target fault n times (n-detection test sets) are
typically generated for restricted values of n due to the increase in test set
size with n. We perform both a worst-case analysis and an average-case analysis
to check the effect of restricting n on the unmodeled fault coverage of an
(arbitrary) n-detection test set. Our analysis is independent of any particular
test set or test generation approach. It is based on a specific set of target
faults and a specific set of untargeted faults. It shows that, depending on the
circuit, very large values of n may be needed to guarantee the detection of all
the untargeted faults. We discuss the implications of these results.

real-time systems using preemptive EDF scheduling. Task sets which are accepted
by previously described sufficient tests will be evaluated in nearly the same
time as with the old tests by the new algorithms. Many task sets are not
accepted by the earlier tests despite them beeing feasible. These task sets
will be evaluated by the new algorithms a lot faster than with known exact
feasibility tests. Therefore it is possible to use them for many applications
for which only sufficient test are suitable. Additionally this paper shows that
the best previous known sufficient test, the best known feasibility bound and
the best known approximation algorithm can be derived from these new tests. In
result this leads to an integrated schedulability theory for EDF.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Complex applications implemented as Systems on Chip (SoCs) demand extensive
use of system level modeling and validation. Their implementation gathers a
large number of complex IP cores and advanced interconnection schemes, such as
hierarchical bus architectures or networks on chip (NoCs). Modeling
applications involves capturing its computation and communication
characteristics. Previously proposed communication weighted models (CWM)
consider only the application communication aspects. This work proposes a
communication dependence and computation model (CDCM) that can simultaneously
consider both aspects of an application. It presents a solution to the problem
of mapping applications on regular NoCs while considering execution time and
energy consumption. The use of CDCM is shown to provide estimated average
reductions of 40% in execution time, and 20% in energy consumption, for current
technologies.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  When applying Dynamic Power Management (DPM) technique to pervasively
deployed embedded systems, the technique needs to be very efficient so that it
is feasible to implement the technique on low end processor and tight-budget
memory. Furthermore, it should have the capability to track time varying
behavior rapidly because the time varying is an inherent characteristic of real
world system. Existing methods, which are usually model-based, may not satisfy
the aforementioned requirements. In this paper, we propose a model-free DPM
technique based on Q-Learning. Q-DPM is much more efficient because it removes
the overhead of parameter estimator and mode-switch controller. Furthermore,
its policy optimization is performed via consecutive online trialing, which
also leads to very rapid response to time varying behavior.

utilizes hardware acceleration for the purpose of fast power estimation. Power
emulation is based on the observation that the functions necessary for power
estimation (power model evaluation, aggregation, etc.) can be implemented as
hardware circuits. Therefore, we can enhance any given design with &quot;power
estimation hardware&quot;, map it to a prototyping platform, and exercise it with
any given test stimuli to obtain power consumption estimates. Our empirical
studies with industrial designs reveal that power emulation can achieve
significant speedups (10X to 500X) over state-of-the-art commercial

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  A class of discrete event synthesis problems can be reduced to solving
language equations f . X &amp;sube; S, where F is the fixed component and S the
specification. Sequential synthesis deals with FSMs when the automata for F and
S are prefix closed, and are naturally represented by multi-level networks with
latches. For this special case, we present an efficient computation, using
partitioned representations, of the most general prefix-closed solution of the
above class of language equations. The transition and the output relations of
the FSMs for F and S in their partitioned form are represented by the sets of
output and next state functions of the corresponding networks. Experimentally,
we show that using partitioned representations is much faster than using
monolithic representations, as well as applicable to larger problem instances.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Memory cores are usually the densest portion with the smallest feature size
in system-on-chip (SOC) designs. The reliability of memory cores thus has heavy
impact on the reliability of SOCs. Transparent test is one of useful technique
for improving the reliability of memories during life time. This paper presents
a systematic algorithm used for transforming a bit-oriented march test into a
transparent word-oriented march test. The transformed transparent march test
has shorter test complexity compared with that proposed in the previous works
[Theory of transparent BIST for RAMs, A transparent online memory test for
simultaneous detection of functional faults and soft errors in memories]. For
example, if a memory with 32-bit words is tested with March C-, time complexity
of the transparent word-oriented test transformed by the proposed scheme is
only about 56% or 19% time complexity of the transparent word-oriented test
converted by the scheme reported in [Theory of transparent BIST for RAMs] or [A
transparent online memory test for simultaneous detection of functional faults
and soft errors in memories], respectively.

affect the correct on-line operation of digital systems, such as memories and
microprocessors; a memory can be made resilient to permanent and transient

systems are compared: these systems utilize simplex and duplex arrangements
with a combination of Reed Solomon coding and scrubbing. The memory systems and
their operations are analyzed by novel Markov chains to characterize
performance for dynamic reconfiguration as well as error detection and
correction under the occurrence of permanent and transient faults. For a

expected to be highly predictable in order to guarantee at design time that

alternative approach which allows the system to benefit from a performance gain
comparable to that of caches while at the same time maintaining predictability.
In this work, we compare the impact of scratchpad memories and caches on worst
case execution time (WCET) analysis results. We show that caches, despite
requiring complex techniques, can have a negative impact on the predicted WCET,
while the estimated WCET for scratchpad memories scales with the achieved
Performance gain at no extra analysis cost.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  In this work we consider battery powered portable systems which either have
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or voltage and frequency scalable
processors as their main processing element. An application is modeled in the
form of a precedence task graph at a coarse level of granularity. We assume
that for each task in the task graph several unique design-points are available
which correspond to different hardware implementations for FPGAs and different
voltage-frequency combinations for processors. It is assumed that performance
and total power consumption estimates for each design-point are available for
any given portable platfrom, including the peripheral components such as memory
and display power usage. We present an iterative heuristic algorithm which
finds a sequence of tasks along with an appropriate design-point for each task,
such that a deadline is met and the amount of battery energy used is as small
as possible. A detailed illustrative example along with a case study of a
real-world application of a robotic arm controller which demonstrates the
usefulness of our algorithm is also presented.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Increasing reuse opportunities is a well-known problem for software designers
as well as for hardware designers. Nonetheless, current software and hardware
engineering practices have embraced different approaches to this problem.
Software designs are usually modelled after a set of proven solutions to
recurrent problems called design patterns. This approach differs from the
component-based reuse usually found in hardware designs: design patterns do not
specify unnecessary implementation details. Several authors have already
proposed translating structural design patterns concepts to hardware design. In
this paper we extend the discussion to behavioural design patterns.
Specifically, we describe how the hardware version of the Iterator can be used
to enhance model reuse.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Side channel attacks are a major security concern for smart cards and other
embedded devices. They analyze the variations on the power consumption to find
the secret key of the encryption algorithm implemented within the security IC.
To address this issue, logic gates that have a constant power dissipation
independent of the input signals, are used in security ICs. This paper presents
a design methodology to create fully connected differential pull down networks.
Fully connected differential pull down networks are transistor networks that
for any complementary input combination connect all the internal nodes of the
network to one of the external nodes of the network. They are memoryless and
for that reason have a constant load capacitance and power consumption. This
type of networks is used in specialized logic gates to guarantee a constant
contribution of the internal nodes into the total power consumption of the
logic gate.

integrated circuit (IC) sensitiveness to radiation. Soft errors are currently
appearing into ICs working at earth surface. Hardened circuits are currently
required in many applications where Fault Tolerance (FT) was not a requirement
in the very near past. The use of platform FPGAs for the emulation of
single-event upset effects (SEU) is gaining attention in order to speed up the
FT evaluation. In this work, a new emulation system for FT evaluation with
respect to SEU effects is proposed, providing shorter evaluation times by
performing all the evaluation process in the FPGA and avoiding emulator-host

  Scheduling</title><categories>cs.OH</categories><comments>Submitted on behalf of EDAA (http://www.edaa.com/)</comments><proxy>ccsd hal-00181580</proxy><journal-ref>Dans Design, Automation and Test in Europe - DATE'05, Munich :
  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  A novel energy reduction strategy to maximally exploit the dynamic workload
variation is proposed for the offline voltage scheduling of preemptive systems.
The idea is to construct a fully-preemptive schedule that leads to minimum
energy consumption when the tasks take on approximately the average execution
cycles yet still guarantees no deadline violation during the worst-case
scenario. End-time for each sub-instance of the tasks obtained from the
schedule is used for the on-line dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) of the tasks.
For the tasks that normally require a small number of cycles but occasionally a
large number of cycles to complete, such a schedule provides more opportunities
for slack utilization and hence results in larger energy saving. The concept is
realized by formulating the problem as a Non-Linear Programming (NLP)
optimization problem. Experimental results show that, by using the proposed
scheme, the total energy consumption at runtime is reduced by as high as 60%
for randomly generated task sets when comparing with the static scheduling
approach only using worst case workload.

significant fraction of the total power. The exponential dependence of static
power with the operating temperature makes the thermal profile estimation of
high-performance ICs a key issue to compute the total power dissipated in

models to estimate the static power dissipation and the temperature of

estimation tool in which numerical procedures are avoided for any computation
to set a faster estimation and optimization. The models developed are compared

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Low power oriented circuit optimization consists in selecting the best
alternative between gate sizing, buffer insertion and logic structure
transformation, for satisfying a delay constraint at minimum area cost. In this
paper we used a closed form model of delay in CMOS structures to define metrics
for a deterministic selection of the optimization alternative. The target is
delay constraint satisfaction with minimum area cost. We validate the design
space exploration method, defining maximum and minimum delay bounds on logical
paths. Then we adapt this method to a &quot;constant sensitivity method&quot; allowing to
size a circuit at minimum area under a delay constraint. An optimisation
protocol is finally defined to manage the trade-off performance constraint -
circuit structure. These methods are implemented in an optimization tool (POPS)
and validated by comparing on a 0.25$\mu$m process, the optimization efficiency
obtained on various benchmarks (ISCAS?85) to that resulting from an industrial
tool.

electronic publishing, XML is also playing an increasingly important role in
the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and elsewhere. XPath language
is the result of an effort to provide address parts of an XML document. In
support of this primary purpose, it becomes in a query language against an XML
document. In this paper we present a proposal for the implementation of the
XPath language in logic programming. With this aim we will describe the
representation of XML documents by means of a logic program. Rules and facts
can be used for representing the document schema and the XML document itself.
In particular, we will present how to index XML documents in logic programs:
rules are supposed to be stored in main memory, however facts are stored in
secondary memory by using two kind of indexes: one for each XML tag, and other
for each group of terminal items. In addition, we will study how to query by
means of the XPath language against a logic program representing an XML
document. It evolves the specialization of the logic program with regard to the
XPath expression. Finally, we will also explain how to combine the indexing and

  Considering Total Leakage</title><categories>cs.AR</categories><comments>Submitted on behalf of EDAA (http://www.edaa.com/)</comments><proxy>ccsd hal-00181660</proxy><journal-ref>Dans Design, Automation and Test in Europe - DATE'05, Munich :
  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  In this paper, we investigate the impact of T_{ox} and Vth on power
performance trade-offs for on-chip caches. We start by examining the
optimization of the various components of a single level cache and then extend
this to two level cache systems. In addition to leakage, our studies also
account for the dynamic power expanded as a result of cache misses. Our results
show that one can often reduce overall power by increasing the size of the L2
cache if we only allow one pair of Vth/T_{ox} in L2. However, if we allow the
memory cells and the peripherals to have their own Vth's and T_{ox}'s, we show
that a two-level cache system with smaller L2's will yield less total leakage.
We further show that two Vth's and two T_{ox}'s are sufficient to get close to
an optimal solution, and that Vth is generally a better design knob than T_{ox}
for leakage optimization, thus it is better to restrict the number of T_{ox}'s
rather than Vth's if cost is a concern.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The increasing complexity and the short life cycles of embedded systems are
pushing the current system-on-chip designs towards a rapid increasing on the
number of programmable processing units, while decreasing the gate count for
custom logic. Considering this trend, this work proposes a test planning method
capable of reusing available processors as test sources and sinks, and the
on-chip network as the test access mechanism. Experimental results are based on
ITC'02 benchmarks and on two open core processors compliant with MIPS and SPARC
instruction set. The results show that the cooperative use of both the on-chip
network and the embedded processors can increase the test parallelism and
reduce the test time without additional cost in area and pins.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Due to the emergence of highly dynamic multimedia applications there is a
need for flexible platforms and run-time scheduling support for embedded
systems. Dynamic Reconfigurable Hardware (DRHW) is a promising candidate to
provide this flexibility but, currently, not sufficient run-time scheduling
support to deal with the run-time reconfigurations exists. Moreover, executing
at run-time a complex scheduling heuristic to provide this support may generate
an excessive run-time penalty. Hence, we have developed a hybrid
design/run-time prefetch heuristic that schedules the reconfigurations at
run-time, but carries out the scheduling computations at design-time by
carefully identifying a set of near-optimal schedules that can be selected at
run-time. This approach provides run-time flexibility with a negligible
penalty.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Overheating has been acknowledged as a major issue in testing complex SOCs.
Several power constrained system-level DFT solutions (power constrained test
scheduling) have recently been proposed to tackle this problem. However, as it
will be shown in this paper, imposing a chip-level maximum power constraint
doesn't necessarily avoid local overheating due to the non-uniform distribution
of power across the chip. This paper proposes a new approach for dealing with
overheating during test, by embedding thermal awareness into test scheduling.
The proposed approach facilitates rapid generation of thermal-safer test
schedules without requiring time-consuming thermal simulations. This is
achieved by employing a low-complexity test session thermal model used to guide
the test schedule generation algorithm. This approach reduces the chances of a
design re-spin due to potential overheating during test.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The advent of sensor networks presents untapped opportunities for synthesis.
We examine the problem of synthesis of behavioral specifications into networks
of programmable sensor blocks. The particular behavioral specification we
consider is an intuitive user-created network diagram of sensor blocks, each
block having a pre-defined combinational or sequential behavior. We synthesize
this specification to a new network that utilizes a minimum number of
programmable blocks in place of the pre-defined blocks, thus reducing network
size and hence network cost and power. We focus on the main task of this
synthesis problem, namely partitioning pre-defined blocks onto a minimum number
of programmable blocks, introducing the efficient but effective PareDown
decomposition algorithm for the task. We describe the synthesis and simulation
tools we developed. We provide results showing excellent network size
reductions through such synthesis, and significant speedups of our algorithm
over exhaustive search while obtaining near-optimal results for 15 real network
designs as well as nearly 10,000 randomly generated designs.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  As compared to a large spectrum of performance optimizations, relatively
little effort has been dedicated to optimize other aspects of embedded
applications such as memory space requirements, power, real-time
predictability, and reliability. In particular, many modern embedded systems
operate under tight memory space constraints. One way of satisfying these
constraints is to compress executable code and data as much as possible. While
research on code compression have studied efficient hardware and software based
code strategies, many of these techniques do not take application behavior into
account, that is, the same compression/decompression strategy is used
irrespective of the application being optimized. This paper presents a code
compression strategy based on control flow graph (CFG) representation of the
embedded program. The idea is to start with a memory image wherein all basic
blocks are compressed, and decompress only the blocks that are predicted to be
needed in the near future. When the current access to a basic block is over,
our approach also decides the point at which the block could be compressed. We
propose several compression and decompression strategies that try to reduce
memory requirements without excessively increasing the original instruction
cycle counts.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The hybrid hiding encryption algorithm, as its name implies, embraces
concepts from both steganography and cryptography. In this exertion, an
improved micro-architecture Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation
of this algorithm is presented. This design overcomes the observed limitations
of a previously-designed micro-architecture. These observed limitations are: no
exploitation of the possibility of parallel bit replacement, and the fact that
the input plaintext was encrypted serially, which caused a dependency between
the throughput and the nature of the used secret key. This dependency can be
viewed by some as vulnerability in the security of the implemented
micro-architecture. The proposed modified micro-architecture is constructed
using five basic modules. These modules are; the message cache, the message
alignment module, the key cache, the comparator, and at last the encryption
module. In this work, we provide comprehensive simulation and implementation
results. These are: the timing diagrams, the post-implementation timing and
routing reports, and finally the floor plan. Moreover, a detailed comparison
with other FPGA implementations is made available and discussed.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Early scheduling algorithms usually adjusted the clock cycle duration to the
execution time of the slowest operation. This resulted in large slack times
wasted in those cycles executing faster operations. To reduce the wasted times
multi-cycle and chaining techniques have been employed. While these techniques
have produced successful designs, its effectiveness is often limited due to the
area increment that may derive from chaining, and the extra latencies that may
derive from multicycling. In this paper we present an optimization method that
solves the time-constrained scheduling problem by transforming behavioural
specifications into new ones whose subsequent synthesis substantially improves
circuit performance. Our proposal breaks up some of the specification
operations, allowing their execution during several possibly unconsecutive
cycles, and also the calculation of several data-dependent operation fragments
in the same cycle. To do so, it takes into account the circuit latency and the
execution time of every specification operation. The experimental results
carried out show that circuits obtained from the optimized specification are on
average 60% faster than those synthesized from the original specification, with
only slight increments in the circuit area.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The widening spectrum of applications and services provided by portable and
embedded devices bring a new dimension of concerns in security. Most of those
embedded systems (pay-TV, PDAs, mobile phones, etc...) make use of external
memory. As a result, the main problem is that data and instructions are
constantly exchanged between memory (RAM) and CPU in clear form on the bus.
This memory may contain confidential data like commercial software or private
contents, which either the end-user or the content provider is willing to
protect. The goal of this paper is to clearly describe the problem of
processor-memory bus communications in this regard and the existing techniques
applied to secure the communication channel through encryption - Performance
overheads implied by those solutions will be extensively discussed in this
paper.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The idea of design domain specific Mother Model of IP block family as a base
of modeling of system integration is presented here. A common reconfigurable
Mother Model for ten different standardized digital OFDM transmitters has been
developed. By means of a set of parameters, the mother model can be
reconfigured to any of the ten selected standards. So far the applicability of
the proposed reconfiguration and analog-digital co-modeling methods have been
proved by modeling the function of the digital parts of three, 802.11a, ADSL
and DRM, transmitters in an RF system simulator. The model is intended to be
used as signal source template in RF system simulations. The concept is not
restricted to signal sources, it can be applied to any IP block development.
The idea of the Mother Model will be applied in other design domains to prove
that in certain application areas, OFDM transceivers in this case, the design
process can progress simultaneously in different design domains - mixed signal,
system and RTL-architectural - without the need of high-level synthesis. Only
the Mother Models of three design domains are needed to be formally proved to
function as specified.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper presents a digital VLSI design flow to create secure, side-channel
attack (SCA) resistant integrated circuits. The design flow starts from a
normal design in a hardware description language such as VHDL or Verilog and
provides a direct path to a SCA resistant layout. Instead of a full custom
layout or an iterative design process with extensive simulations, a few key
modifications are incorporated in a regular synchronous CMOS standard cell
design flow. We discuss the basis for side-channel attack resistance and adjust
the library databases and constraints files of the synthesis and place &amp; route
procedures accordingly. Experimental results show that a DPA attack on a
regular single ended CMOS standard cell implementation of a module of the DES
algorithm discloses the secret key after 200 measurements. The same attack on a
secure version still does not disclose the secret key after more than 2000
measurements.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  While loop restructuring based code optimization for array intensive
applications has been successful in the past, it has several problems such as
the requirement of checking dependences (legality issues) and transformation of
all of the array references within the loop body indiscriminately (while some
of the references can benefit from the transformation, others may not). As a
result, data transformations, i.e., transformations that modify memory layout
of array data instead of loop structure have been proposed. One of the problems
associated with data transformations is the difficulty of selecting a memory
layout for an array that is acceptable to the entire program (not just to a
single loop). In this paper, we formulate the problem of determining the memory
layouts of arrays as a constraint network, and explore several methods of
solution in a systematic way. Our experiments provide strong support in favor
of employing constraint processing, and point out future research directions.

on average. We also present the development procedure of TLM of a bus

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The algorithms used in wireless applications are increasingly more
sophisticated and consequently more challenging to implement in hardware.
Traditional design flows require developing the micro architecture, coding the
RTL, and verifying the generated RTL against the original functional C or
MATLAB specification. This paper describes a C-based design flow that is well
suited for the hardware implementation of DSP algorithms commonly found in
wireless applications. The C design flow relies on guided synthesis to generate
the RTL directly from the untimed C algorithm. The specifics of the C-based
design flow are described using a simple DSP filtering algorithm consisting of
a forward adaptive equalizer, a 64-QAM slicer and an adaptive decision feedback
equalizer. The example illustrates some of the capabilities and advantages
offered by this flow.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Securing communication channels is especially needed in wireless
environments. But applying cipher mechanisms in software is limited by the
calculation and energy resources of the mobile devices. If hardware is applied
to realize cryptographic operations cost becomes an issue. In this paper we
describe an approach which tackles all these three points. We implemented a
hardware accelerator for polynomial multiplication in extended Galois fields
(GF) applying Karatsuba's method iteratively. With this approach the area
consumption is reduced to 2.1 mm^2 in comparison to. 6.2 mm^2 for the standard
application of Karatsuba's method i.e. for recursive application. Our approach
also reduces the energy consumption to 60 per cent of the original approach.
The price we have to pay for these achievement is the increased execution time.
In our implementation a polynomial multiplication takes 3 clock cycles whereas
the recurisve Karatsuba approach needs only one clock cycle. But considering
area, energy and calculation speed we are convinced that the benefits of our
approach outweigh its drawback.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The JPEG2000 standard defines the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as a
linear space-to-frequency transform of the image domain in an irreversible
compression. This irreversible discrete wavelet transform is implemented by FIR
filter using 9/7 Daubechies coefficients or a lifting scheme of factorizated
coefficients from 9/7 Daubechies coefficients. This work investigates the
tradeoffs between area, power and data throughput (or operating frequency) of
several implementations of the Discrete Wavelet Transform using the lifting
scheme in various pipeline designs. This paper shows the results of five
different architectures synthesized and simulated in FPGAs. It concludes that
the descriptions with pipelined operators provide the best area-power-operating
frequency trade-off over non-pipelined operators descriptions. Those
descriptions require around 40% more hardware to increase the maximum operating
frequency up to 100% and reduce power consumption to less than 50%. Starting
from behavioral HDL descriptions provide the best area-power-operating
frequency trade-off, improving hardware cost and maximum operating frequency
around 30% in comparison to structural descriptions for the same power
requirement.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  One of the main bottlenecks when designing a network processing system is
very often its memory subsystem. This is mainly due to the state-of-the-art
network links operating at very high speeds and to the fact that in order to
support advanced Quality of Service (QoS), a large number of independent queues
is desirable. In this paper we analyze the performance bottlenecks of various
data memory managers integrated in typical Network Processing Units (NPUs). We
expose the performance limitations of software implementations utilizing the
RISC processing cores typically found in most NPU architectures and we identify
the requirements for hardware assisted memory management in order to achieve
wire-speed operation at gigabit per second rates. Furthermore, we describe the
architecture and performance of a hardware memory manager that fulfills those
requirements. This memory manager, although it is implemented in a
reconfigurable technology, it can provide up to 6.2Gbps of aggregate
throughput, while handling 32K independent queues.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  As digital content services gain importance in the mobile world, Digital
Rights Management (DRM) applications will become a key component of mobile
terminals. This paper examines the effect dedicated hardware macros for
specific cryptographic functions have on the performance of a mobile terminal
that supports version 2 of the open standard for Digital Rights Management
defined by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA). Following a general description of
the standard, the paper contains a detailed analysis of the cryptographic
operations that have to be carried out before protected content can be
accessed. The combination of this analysis with data on execution times for
specific algorithms realized in hardware and software has made it possible to
build a model which has allowed us to assert that hardware acceleration for
specific cryptographic algorithms can significantly reduce the impact DRM has
on a mobile terminal's processing performance and battery life.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Motion estimation is the most critical process in video coding systems. First
of all, it has a definitive impact on the rate-distortion performance given by
the video encoder. Secondly, it is the most computationally intensive process
within the encoding loop. For these reasons, the design of high-performance
low-cost motion estimators is a crucial task in the video compression field. An
adaptive cost block matching (ACBM) motion estimation technique is presented in
this paper, featuring an excellent tradeoff between the quality of the
reconstructed video sequences and the computational effort. Simulation results
demonstrate that the ACBM algorithm achieves a slight better rate-distortion
performance than the one given by the well-known full search algorithm block
matching algorithm with reductions of up to 95% in the computational load.

  Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Customization of processor architectures through Instruction Set Extensions
(ISEs) is an effective way to meet the growing performance demands of embedded
applications. A high-quality ISE generation approach needs to obtain results
close to those achieved by experienced designers, particularly for complex
applications that exhibit regularity: expert designers are able to exploit
manually such regularity in the data flow graphs to generate high-quality ISEs.
In this paper, we present ISEGEN, an approach that identifies high-quality ISEs
by iterative improvement following the basic principles of the well-known
Kernighan-Lin (K-L) min-cut heuristic. Experimental results on a number of
MediaBench, EEMBC and cryptographic applications show that our approach matches
the quality of the optimal solution obtained by exhaustive search. We also show
that our ISEGEN technique is on average 20x faster than a genetic formulation
that generates equivalent solutions. Furthermore, the ISEs identified by our
technique exhibit 35% more speedup than the genetic solution on a large
cryptographic application (AES) by effectively exploiting its regular
structure.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Visual information processing will play an increasingly important role in
future electronics systems. In many applications, e.g. video surveillance
cameras, data throughput of microprocessors is not sufficient and power
consumption is too high. Instruction profiling on a typical test algorithm has
shown that pixel address calculations are the dominant operations to be
optimized. Therefore AddressLib, a structured scheme for pixel addressing was
developed, that can be accelerated by AddressEngine, a coprocessor for visual
information processing. In this paper, the architectural design of
AddressEngine is described, which in the first step supports a subset of the
AddressLib. Dataflow and memory organization are optimized during architectural
design. AddressEngine was implemented in a FPGA and was tested with MPEG-7
Global Motion Estimation algorithm. Results on processing speed and circuit
complexity are given and compared to a pure software implementation. The next
step will be the support for the full AddressLib, including segment addressing.
An outlook on further investigations on dynamic reconfiguration capabilities is
given.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The importance of embedded systems in driving innovation in automotive
applications continues to grow. Understanding the specific needs of developers
targeting this market is also helping to drive innovation in RISC core design.
This paper describes how a RISC instruction set architecture has evolved to
better meet those needs, and the key implementation features in two very
different RISC cores are used to demonstrate the challenges of designing for
real-time automotive systems.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The introduction of complex SoCs with multiple processor cores presents new
development challenges, such that development support is now a decisive factor
when choosing a System-on-Chip (SoC). The presented developments support
strategy addresses the challenges using both architecture and technology
approaches. The Multi-Core Debug Support (MCDS) architecture provides flexible
triggering using cross triggers and a multiple core break and suspend switch.
Temporal trace ordering is guaranteed down to cycle level by on-chip time
stamping. The Package Sized-ICE (PSI) approach is a novel method of including
trace buffers, overlay memories, processing resources and communication
interfaces without changing device behavior. PSI requires no external emulation
box, as the debug host interfaces directly with the SoC using a standard
interface.

of visual cryptography schemes. In this regard, we consider visual cryptography
schemes introduced by Tzeng and Hu [13]. In such a model, only minimal
qualified sets can recover the secret image and that the recovered secret image
can be darker or lighter than the background. Blundo et al. [4] introduced a
lower bound for the best pixel expansion of this scheme in terms of minimal
qualified sets. We present another lower bound for the best pixel expansion of
the scheme. As a corollary, we introduce a lower bound, based on an induced
matching of hypergraph of qualified sets, for the best pixel expansion of the
aforementioned model and the traditional model of visual cryptography realized
by basis matrices. Finally, we study access structures based on graphs and we
present an upper bound for the smallest pixel expansion in terms of strong
chromatic index.

working in a harsh environment with high safety critical requirements is
described. The driver can be used with a wide range of external components
parameters (LC resonance network of a sensor). Quality factor of the external
LC network can vary two decades. Amplitude regulation of the driver is
digitally controlled and the DAC is constructed as exponential with
piece-wise-linear (PWL) approximation. Low current consumption for high quality
resonance networks is achieved. Realized oscillator is robust, used in safety
critical application and has low EMC emissions.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  We present a system for the boresighting of sensors using inertial
measurement devices as the basis for developing a range of dynamic real-time
sensor fusion applications. The proof of concept utilizes a COTS FPGA platform
for sensor fusion and real-time correction of a misaligned video sensor. We
exploit a custom-designed 32-bit soft processor core and C-based design &amp;
synthesis for rapid, platform-neutral development. Kalman filter and sensor
fusion techniques established in advanced aviation systems are applied to
automotive vehicles with results exceeding typical industry requirements for
sensor alignment. Results of the static and the dynamic tests demonstrate that
using inexpensive accelerometers mounted on (or during assembly of) a sensor
and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) fixed to a vehicle can be used to
compute the misalignment of the sensor to the IMU and thus vehicle. In some
cases the model predications and test results exceeded the requirements by an
order of magnitude with a 3-sigma or 99% confidence.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  In this paper a general architecture suitable to interface several kinds of
sensors for automotive applications is presented. A platform based design
approach is pursued to improve system performance while minimizing
time-to-market.. The platform is composed by an analog front-end and a digital
section. The latter is based on a microcontroller core (8051 IP by Oregano)
plus a set of dedicated hardware dedicated to the complex signal processing
required for sensor conditioning. The microcontroller handles also the
communication with external devices (as a PC) for data output and fast
prototyping. A case study is presented concerning the conditioning of a Gyro
yaw rate sensor for automotive applications. Measured performance results
outperform current state-of-the-art commercial devices.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Presented are a methodology and a DFII-based tool for AC-stability analysis
of a wide variety of closed-loop continuous-time (operational amplifiers and
other linear circuits). The methodology used allows for easy identification and
diagnostics of ac-stability problems including not only main-loop effects but
also local-instability loops in current mirrors, bias circuits and emitter or
source followers without breaking the loop. The results of the analysis are
easy to interpret. Estimated phase margin is readily available. Instability
nodes and loops along with their respective oscillation frequencies are
immediately identified and mapped to the existing circuit nodes thus offering
significant advantages compared to traditional &quot;black-box&quot; methods of stability
analysis (Transient Overshoot, Bode and Phase margin plots etc.). The tool for
AC-Stability analysis is written in SKILL? and is fully integrated in DFII?
environment. Its &quot;push-button&quot; graphical user interface (GUI) is easy to use
and understand. The tool can be invoked directly from Composer? schematic and
does not require active Analog Artist? session. The tool is not dependent on
the use of a specific fabrication technology or Process Design Kit
customization. It requires OCEAN?, Spectre? and Waveform calculator
capabilities to run.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  A 6bit flash-ADC with 1.2GSps, wide analog bandwidth and low power, realized
in a standard digital 0.13 $\mu$m CMOS copper technology is presented.
Employing capacitive interpolation gives various advantages when designing for
low power: no need for a reference resistor ladder, implicit sample-and-hold
operation, no edge effects in the interpolation network (as compared to
resistive interpolation), and a very low input capacitance of only 400fF, which
leads to an easily drivable analog converter interface. Operating at 1.2GSps
the ADC achieves an effective resolution bandwidth (ERBW) of 700MHz, while
consuming 160mW of power. At 600MSps we achieve an ERBW of 600MHz with only
90mW power consumption, both from a 1.5V supply. This corresponds to
outstanding Figure-of-Merit numbers (FoM) of 2.2 and 1.5pJ/convstep,
respectively. The module area is 0.12mm^2.

0.86mm^2 and the power consumption equals 97mW. A switched capacitor bias
current circuit scale the bias current automatically with the conversion rate,
which gives scaleable power consumption and full performance of the ADC from 20

a logic core to be included in System-on-a-chip (SoC) environments. The
approach advantages are the ability to protect the core IP, the simple test
interface (thanks also to the adoption of the P1500 standard), the possibility
to run the test at-speed, the reduced test time, and the good diagnostic
capabilities. The paper reports figures about the achieved fault coverage, the
required area overhead, and the performance slowdown, and compares the figures
with those for alternative approaches, such as those based on full scan and
sequential ATPG.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  At 130 nm and 90 nm, power consumption (both dynamic and static) has become a
barrier in the roadmap for SoC designs targeting battery powered, mobile
applications. This paper presents the results of dynamic and static power
reduction achieved implementing Tensilica's 32-bit Xtensa microprocessor core,
using Virtual Silicon's Power Management IP. Independent voltage islands are
created using Virtual Silicon's VIP PowerSaver standard cells by using voltage
level shifting cells and voltage isolation cells to implement power islands.
The VIP PowerSaver standard cells are characterized at 1.2V, 1.0V and 0.8V, to
accommodate voltage scaling. Power islands can also be turned off completely.
Designers can significantly lower both the dynamic power and the quiescent or
leakage power of their SoC designs, with very little impact on speed or area
using Virtual Silicon's VIP Gate Bias standard cells.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  The MultiNoC system implements a programmable on-chip multiprocessing
platform built on top of an efficient, low area overhead intra-chip
interconnection scheme. The employed interconnection structure is a Network on
Chip, or NoC. NoCs are emerging as a viable alternative to increasing demands
on interconnection architectures, due to the following characteristics: (i)
energy efficiency and reliability; (ii) scalability of bandwidth, when compared
to traditional bus architectures; (iii) reusability; (iv) distributed routing
decisions. An external host computer feeds MultiNoC with application
instructions and data. After this initialization procedure, MultiNoC executes
some algorithm. After finishing execution of the algorithm, output data can be
read back by the host. Sequential or parallel algorithms conveniently adapted
to the MultiNoC structure can be executed. The main motivation to propose this
design is to enable the investigation of current trends to increase the number
of embedded processors in SoCs, leading to the concept of &quot;sea of processors&quot;
systems.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  In this paper, we propose a methodology for partitioning and mapping
computational intensive applications in reconfigurable hardware blocks of
different granularity. A generic hybrid reconfigurable architecture is
considered so as the methodology can be applicable to a large number of
heterogeneous reconfigurable platforms. The methodology mainly consists of two
stages, the analysis and the mapping of the application onto fine and
coarse-grain hardware resources. A prototype framework consisting of analysis,
partitioning and mapping tools has been also developed. For the coarse-grain
reconfigurable hardware, we use our previous-developed high-performance
coarse-grain data-path. In this work, the methodology is validated using two
real-world applications, an OFDM transmitter and a JPEG encoder. In the case of
the OFDM transmitter, a maximum clock cycles decrease of 82% relative to the
ones in an all fine-grain mapping solution is achieved. The corresponding
performance improvement for the JPEG is 43%.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper evaluates the use of pin and cycle accurate SystemC models for
embedded system design exploration and early software development. The target
system is MicroBlaze VanillaNet Platform running MicroBlaze uClinux operating
system. The paper compares Register Transfer Level (RTL) Hardware Description
Language (HDL) simulation speed to the simulation speed of several different
SystemC models. It is shown that simulation speed of pin and cycle accurate
models can go up to 150 kHz, compared to 100 Hz range of HDL simulation.
Furthermore, utilising techniques that temporarily compromise cycle accuracy,
effective simulation speed of up to 500 kHz can be obtained.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Recently a lot of multimedia applications are emerging on portable
appliances. They require both the flexibility of upgradeable devices
(traditionally software based) and a powerful computing engine (typically
hardware). In this context, programmable HW and dynamic reconfiguration allow
novel approaches to the migration of algorithms from SW to HW. Thus, in the
frame of the Symbad project, we propose an industrial design flow for
reconfigurable SoC's. The goal of Symbad consists of developing a system level
design platform for hardware and software SoC systems including formal and
semi-formal verification techniques.

identification of a sudden and unobservable change in the distribution of a
random sequence. In this problem, the common probability law of a sequence of
i.i.d. random variables suddenly changes at some disorder time to one of
finitely many alternatives. This disorder time marks the start of a new regime,
whose fingerprint is the new law of observations. Both the disorder time and
the identity of the new regime are unknown and unobservable. The objective is
to detect the regime-change as soon as possible, and, at the same time, to
determine its identity as accurately as possible. Prompt and correct diagnosis
is crucial for quick execution of the most appropriate measures in response to
the new regime, as in fault detection and isolation in industrial processes,
and target detection and identification in national defense. The problem is
formulated in a Bayesian framework. An optimal sequential decision strategy is
found, and an accurate numerical scheme is described for its implementation.
Geometrical properties of the optimal strategy are illustrated via numerical
examples. The traditional problems of Bayesian change-detection and Bayesian
sequential multi-hypothesis testing are solved as special cases. In addition, a
solution is obtained for the problem of detection and identification of
component failure(s) in a system with suspended animation.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  Formal verification techniques have been playing an important role in
pre-silicon validation processes. One of the most important points considered
in performing formal verification is to define good verification scopes; we
should define clearly what to be verified formally upon designs under tests. We
considered the following three practical requirements when we defined the scope
of formal verification. They are (a) hard to verify (b) small to handle, and
(c) easy to understand. Our novel approach is to break down generic properties
for system into stereotype properties in block level and to define requirements
for Verifiable RTL. Consequently, each designer instead of verification experts
can describe properties of the design easily, and formal model checking can be
applied systematically and thoroughly to all the leaf modules. During the
development of a component chip for server platforms, we focused on RAS
(Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability) features and described more
than 2000 properties in PSL. As a result of the formal verification, we found
several critical logic bugs in a short time with limited resources, and
successfully verified all of them. This paper presents a study of the
functional verification methodology.

  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper deals with a common verification methodology and environment for
SystemC BCA and RTL models. The aim is to save effort by avoiding the same work
done twice by different people and to reuse the same environment for the two
design views. Applying this methodology the verification task starts as soon as
the functional specification is signed off and it runs in parallel to the
models and design development. The verification environment is modeled with the
aid of dedicated verification languages and it is applied to both the models.
The test suite is exactly the same and thus it's possible to verify the
alignment between the two models. In fact the final step is to check the
cycle-by-cycle match of the interface behavior. A regression tool and a bus
analyzer have been developed to help the verification and the alignment
process. The former is used to automate the testbench generation and to run the
two test suites. The latter is used to verify the alignment between the two
models comparing the waveforms obtained in each run. The quality metrics used
to validate the flow are full functional coverage and full alignment at each IP
port.

methodology (ADVM) that was created and implemented for a chip card project at
Infineon Technologies AG. The primary advantage of this methodology is that it
enables rapid porting of directed tests to new targets and derivatives, with
only a minimum amount of code refactoring. As a consequence, considerable
verification development time and effort was saved.

networks is considered in this work. An analytical measure of anonymity in
eavesdropped networks is proposed using the information theoretic concept of
equivocation. For a physical layer with orthogonal transmitter directed
signaling, scheduling and relaying techniques are designed to maximize
achievable network performance for any given level of anonymity. The network
performance is measured by the achievable relay rates from the sources to
destinations under latency and medium access constraints. In particular,
analytical results are presented for two scenarios:
  For a two-hop network with maximum anonymity, achievable rate regions for a
general m x 1 relay are characterized when nodes generate independent Poisson
transmission schedules. The rate regions are presented for both strict and
average delay constraints on traffic flow through the relay.
  For a multihop network with an arbitrary anonymity requirement, the problem
of maximizing the sum-rate of flows (network throughput) is considered. A
selective independent scheduling strategy is designed for this purpose, and
using the analytical results for the two-hop network, the achievable throughput
is characterized as a function of the anonymity level. The throughput-anonymity
relation for the proposed strategy is shown to be equivalent to an information
theoretic rate-distortion function.

Submitted to IEEE Trans. on IT, Information-theoretic
  Security special issue, February 2007. Revised October 2007</comments><abstract>  The distributed source coding problem is considered when the sensors, or
encoders, are under Byzantine attack; that is, an unknown group of sensors have
been reprogrammed by a malicious intruder to undermine the reconstruction at
the fusion center. Three different forms of the problem are considered. The
first is a variable-rate setup, in which the decoder adaptively chooses the
rates at which the sensors transmit. An explicit characterization of the
variable-rate achievable sum rates is given for any number of sensors and any
groups of traitors. The converse is proved constructively by letting the
traitors simulate a fake distribution and report the generated values as the
true ones. This fake distribution is chosen so that the decoder cannot
determine which sensors are traitors while maximizing the required rate to
decode every value. Achievability is proved using a scheme in which the decoder
receives small packets of information from a sensor until its message can be
decoded, before moving on to the next sensor. The sensors use randomization to
choose from a set of coding functions, which makes it probabilistically
impossible for the traitors to cause the decoder to make an error. Two forms of
the fixed-rate problem are considered, one with deterministic coding and one
with randomized coding. The achievable rate regions are given for both these
problems, and it is shown that lower rates can be achieved with randomized
coding.

Covert nodes refer to the nodes which are not observable directly. They
transmit the influence and affect the resulting collaborative activities among
the persons in a social network, but do not appear in the surveillance logs
which record the participants of the collaborative activities. Discovering the
covert nodes is identifying the suspicious logs where the covert nodes would
appear if the covert nodes became overt. The performance of the methods is
demonstrated with a test dataset generated from computationally synthesized
networks and a real organization.

multiterminal source coding network called a generalized complementary delivery
network. In this network, messages from multiple correlated sources are jointly
encoded, and each decoder has access to some of the messages to enable it to
reproduce the other messages. Both fixed-to-fixed length and fixed-to-variable
length lossless coding schemes are considered. Explicit constructions of
universal codes and the bounds of the error probabilities are clarified by
using methods of types and graph-theoretical analysis.

source of unpredictable bits for use in security applications. Bit strings
derived from speckle can be used for a variety of security purposes such as
identification, authentication, anti-counterfeiting, secure key storage, random
number generation and tamper protection. The choice of laser speckle as a
source of random keys is quite natural, given the chaotic properties of
speckle. However, this same chaotic behaviour also causes reproducibility
problems. Cryptographic protocols require either zero noise or very low noise
in their inputs; hence the issue of error rates is critical to applications of
laser speckle in cryptography. Most of the literature uses an error reduction
method based on Gabor filtering. Though the method is successful, it has not
been thoroughly analysed.
  In this paper we present a statistical analysis of Gabor-filtered speckle
patterns. We introduce a model in which perturbations are described as random
phase changes in the source plane. Using this model we compute the second and
fourth order statistics of Gabor coefficients. We determine the mutual
information between perturbed and unperturbed Gabor coefficients and the bit
error rate in the derived bit string. The mutual information provides an
absolute upper bound on the number of secure bits that can be reproducibly
extracted from noisy measurements.

network access, combined with the current lack of robust authenticity and
privacy, hamstrings the current internet. The collection of disjoint and often
ad-hoc technologies currently in use are at least partially responsible for the
magnitude and potency of the plagues besetting the information economy, of
which spam and email borne virii are canonical examples. The proposed
replacement for the internet, Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), does little
to tackle these underlying issues, instead concentrating on addressing the
technical issues of a decade ago.
  This paper introduces CANE, a Content Addressed Network Environment, and
compares it against current internet and related technologies. Specifically,
CANE presents a simple computing environment in which location is abstracted
away in favour of identity, and trust is explicitly defined. Identity is
cryptographically verified and yet remains pervasively open in nature. It is
argued that this approach is capable of being generalised such that file
storage and network access can be unified and subsequently combined with human
interfaces to result in a Unified Theory of Access, which addresses many of the
significant problems besetting the internet community of the early 21st
century.

measurement is an important intermediate step in gene mapping studies, and has
received much attention recently. Consequently, a variety of methods for this
problem have been developed. Different methods employ different statistical
models, and thus implicitly encode different assumptions about the nature of
the underlying haplotype structure. Depending on the population sample in
question, their relative performance can vary greatly, and it is unclear which
method to choose for a particular sample. Instead of choosing a single method,
we explore combining predictions returned by different methods in a principled
way, and thereby circumvent the problem of method selection.
  We propose several techniques for combining haplotype reconstructions and
analyze their computational properties. In an experimental study on real-world
haplotype data we show that such techniques can provide more accurate and
robust reconstructions, and are useful for outlier detection. Typically, the
combined prediction is at least as accurate as or even more accurate than the
best individual method, effectively circumventing the method selection problem.

$\{X_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ is to estimate the probability that $X_{n+1}=1$ based

distribution of the process $\{X_n\}$. It is known that this is not possible if
one estimates at all values of $n$. We present a simple procedure which will
attempt to make such a prediction infinitely often at carefully selected
stopping times chosen by the algorithm. We show that the proposed procedure is
consistent under certain conditions, and we estimate the growth rate of the
stopping times.

subspaces in which every nonzero element is decomposable. In geometric terms,
this corresponds to characterizing the projective linear subvarieties of the
Grassmann variety with its Plucker embedding. When the base field is finite, we
consider the more general question of determining the maximum number of points
on sections of Grassmannians by linear subvarieties of a fixed (co)dimension.
This corresponds to a known open problem of determining the complete weight
hierarchy of linear error correcting codes associated to Grassmann varieties.
We recover most of the known results as well as prove some new results. In the
process we obtain, and utilize, a simple generalization of the Griesmer-Wei
bound for arbitrary linear codes.

  Bioinformatics and Systems Biology. See http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bsb/</comments><abstract>  Questions of understanding and quantifying the representation and amount of
information in organisms have become a central part of biological research, as
they potentially hold the key to fundamental advances. In this paper, we
demonstrate the use of information-theoretic tools for the task of identifying
segments of biomolecules (DNA or RNA) that are statistically correlated. We
develop a precise and reliable methodology, based on the notion of mutual
information, for finding and extracting statistical as well as structural
dependencies. A simple threshold function is defined, and its use in
quantifying the level of significance of dependencies between biological
segments is explored. These tools are used in two specific applications. First,
for the identification of correlations between different parts of the maize
zmSRp32 gene. There, we find significant dependencies between the 5'
untranslated region in zmSRp32 and its alternatively spliced exons. This
observation may indicate the presence of as-yet unknown alternative splicing
mechanisms or structural scaffolds. Second, using data from the FBI's Combined
DNA Index System (CODIS), we demonstrate that our approach is particularly well
suited for the problem of discovering short tandem repeats, an application of
importance in genetic profiling.

  Interference-Limited and Noise-Limited Regimes</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to IEEE Trans. Information Theory</comments><abstract>  A network of $n$ wireless communication links is considered in a Rayleigh
fading environment. It is assumed that each link can be active and transmit
with a constant power $P$ or remain silent. The objective is to maximize the
number of active links such that each active link can transmit with a constant
rate $\lambda$. An upper bound is derived that shows the number of active links
scales at most like $\frac{1}{\lambda} \log n$. To obtain a lower bound, a
decentralized link activation strategy is described and analyzed. It is shown
that for small values of $\lambda$, the number of supported links by this
strategy meets the upper bound; however, as $\lambda$ grows, this number
becomes far below the upper bound. To shrink the gap between the upper bound
and the achievability result, a modified link activation strategy is proposed
and analyzed based on some results from random graph theory. It is shown that
this modified strategy performs very close to the optimum. Specifically, this
strategy is \emph{asymptotically almost surely} optimum when $\lambda$
approaches $\infty$ or 0. It turns out the optimality results are obtained in
an interference-limited regime. It is demonstrated that, by proper selection of
the algorithm parameters, the proposed scheme also allows the network to
operate in a noise-limited regime in which the transmission rates can be
adjusted by the transmission powers. The price for this flexibility is a
decrease in the throughput scaling law by a multiplicative factor of $\log \log
n$.

the suboptimal iterative decodings for short or medium length LDPC codes, we
present a generalized ordered statistic decoding (OSD) in the form of syndrome
decoding, to cascade with the belief propagation (BP) or enhanced min-sum
decoding. The OSD is invoked only when the decoding failures are obtained for
the preceded iterative decoding method. With respect to the existing OSD which
is based on the accumulated log-likelihood ratio (LLR) metric, we extend the
accumulative metric to the situation where the BP decoding is in the
probability domain. Moreover, after generalizing the accumulative metric to the
context of the normalized or offset min-sum decoding, the OSD shows appealing
tradeoff between performance and complexity. In the OSD implementation, when
deciding the true error pattern among many candidates, an alternative proposed
proves to be effective to reduce the number of real additions without
performance loss. Simulation results demonstrate that the cascade connection of
enhanced min-sum and OSD decodings outperforms the BP alone significantly, in
terms of either performance or complexity.

protocol at the data link layer by including the impact of both transmission
channel and capture effects in Rayleigh fading environment. Impacts of both
non-ideal channel and capture effects, specially in an environment of high

far as the 4-way handshaking mechanism is concerned, we extend the
multi-dimensional Markovian state transition model characterizing the behavior
at the MAC layer by including transmission states that account for packet
transmission failures due to errors caused by propagation through the channel.
This way, any channel model characterizing the physical transmission medium can
be accommodated, including AWGN and fading channels. We also extend the Markov
model in order to consider the behavior of the contention window when employing
the basic 2-way handshaking mechanism.
  Under the usual assumptions regarding the traffic generated per node and
independence of packet collisions, we solve for the stationary probabilities of
the Markov chain and develop expressions for the saturation throughput as a
function of the number of terminals, packet sizes, raw channel error rates,
capture probability, and other key system parameters. The theoretical
derivations are then compared to simulation results confirming the
effectiveness of the proposed models.

  Network of Randomly Distributed Nodes</title><categories>cs.NI cs.DM cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>To appear on IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, November
  2007</comments><abstract>  This article deals with localization probability in a network of randomly
distributed communication nodes contained in a bounded domain. A fraction of
the nodes denoted as L-nodes are assumed to have localization information while
the rest of the nodes denoted as NL nodes do not. The basic model assumes each
node has a certain radio coverage within which it can make relative distance
measurements. We model both the case radio coverage is fixed and the case radio
coverage is determined by signal strength measurements in a Log-Normal
Shadowing environment. We apply the probabilistic method to determine the
probability of NL-node localization as a function of the coverage area to
domain area ratio and the density of L-nodes. We establish analytical
expressions for this probability and the transition thresholds with respect to
key parameters whereby marked change in the probability behavior is observed.
The theoretical results presented in the article are supported by simulations.

  Channel and Capture Effects</title><categories>cs.NI</categories><comments>Accepted for oral presentation to IEEE Globecom 2007, Washington
  D.C., November 2007</comments><abstract>  In this paper, we provide a throughput analysis of the IEEE 802.11 protocol
at the data link layer in non-saturated traffic conditions taking into account
the impact of both transmission channel and capture effects in Rayleigh fading
environment. Impacts of both non-ideal channel and capture become important in
terms of the actual observed throughput in typical network conditions whereby
traffic is mainly unsaturated, specially in an environment of high
interference.
  We extend the multi-dimensional Markovian state transition model
characterizing the behavior at the MAC layer by including transmission states
that account for packet transmission failures due to errors caused by
propagation through the channel, along with a state characterizing the system
when there are no packets to be transmitted in the buffer of a station.

  Australia, November 19-21, 2007</comments><abstract>  Proof-of-work (POW) schemes have been proposed in the past. One prominent
system is HASHCASH (Back, 2002) which uses cryptographic puzzles . However,
work by Laurie and Clayton (2004) has shown that for a uniform proof-of-work
scheme on email to have an impact on SPAM, it would also be onerous enough to
impact on senders of &quot;legitimate&quot; email. I suggest that a non-uniform
proof-of-work scheme on email may be a solution to this problem, and describe a
framework that has the potential to limit SPAM, without unduly penalising
legitimate senders, and is constructed using only current SPAM filter
technology, and a small change to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
Specifically, I argue that it is possible to make sending SPAM 1,000 times more
expensive than sending &quot;legitimate&quot; email (so called HAM). Also, unlike the
system proposed by Debin Liu and Jean Camp (2006), it does not require the
complications of maintaining a reputation system.

on interval neutrosophic set. Our data model is capable of manipulating
incomplete as well as inconsistent information. Fuzzy relation or
intuitionistic fuzzy relation can only handle incomplete information.
Associated with each relation are two membership functions one is called
truth-membership function T which keeps track of the extent to which we believe
the tuple is in the relation, another is called falsity-membership function F
which keeps track of the extent to which we believe that it is not in the
relation. A neutrosophic relation is inconsistent if there exists one tuple a
such that T(a) + F(a) &gt; 1 . In order to handle inconsistent situation, we
propose an operator called &quot;split&quot; to transform inconsistent neutrosophic
relations into pseudo-consistent neutrosophic relations and do the
set-theoretic and relation-theoretic operations on them and finally use another
operator called &quot;combine&quot; to transform the result back to neutrosophic
relation. For this data model, we define algebraic operators that are
generalizations of the usual operators such as intersection, union, selection,
join on fuzzy relations. Our data model can underlie any database and
knowledge-base management system that deals with incomplete and inconsistent
information.

computing a matching of applicants to items, i.e., a function M mapping A to I;
here we assume that each applicant $x \in A$ provides a preference list on
items in I. We say that an applicant $x \in A$ prefers an item p than an item q
if p is located at a higher position than q in its preference list, and we say
that x prefers a matching M over a matching M' if x prefers M(x) over M'(x).
For a given matching problem A, I, and preference lists, we say that M is more
popular than M' if the number of applicants preferring M over M' is larger than
that of applicants preferring M' over M, and M is called a popular matching if
there is no other matching that is more popular than M. Here we consider the
situation that A is partitioned into $A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{k}$, and that each
$A_{i}$ is assigned a weight $w_{i}&gt;0$ such that w_{1}&gt;w_{2}&gt;...&gt;w_{k}&gt;0$. For
such a matching problem, we say that M is more popular than M' if the total
weight of applicants preferring M over M' is larger than that of applicants
preferring M' over M, and we call M an k-weighted popular matching if there is
no other matching that is more popular than M. In this paper, we analyze the
2-weighted matching problem, and we show that (lower bound) if
$m/n^{4/3}=o(1)$, then a random instance of the 2-weighted matching problem
with $w_{1} \geq 2w_{2}$ has a 2-weighted popular matching with probability
o(1); and (upper bound) if $n^{4/3}/m = o(1)$, then a random instance of the
2-weighted matching problem with $w_{1} \geq 2w_{2}$ has a 2-weighted popular
matching with probability 1-o(1).

its minimum cut. Furthermore, we establish upper and lower bounds for wireless
nodes using Chernoff bound. Our experiments show that our theoretical
predictions are well matched by simulation results.

environment for the autonomic management of clustered J2EE application servers,
developed in the INRIA SARDES research team. Towards this objective, we use the
java ProActive grid technology. We first present some of the challenges to turn
such an autonomic management system initially dedicated to distributed
applications running on clusters of machines, into one that can provide
self-management capabilities to large-scale systems, i.e. deployed on grid
infrastructures. This leads us to a brief state of the art on grid monitoring
systems. Then, we recall the architecture of Jade, and consequently propose to
reorganize it in a potentially more scalable way. Practical experiments pertain
to the use of the grid deployment feature offered by ProActive to easily
conduct the deployment of the Jade system or its revised version on any sort of
grid.

an average-power-constrained one-to-two Gaussian broadcast channel. The
transmitter observes the source and describes it to the two receivers by means
of an average-power-constrained signal. Each receiver observes the transmitted
signal corrupted by a different additive white Gaussian noise and wishes to
estimate the source component intended for it. That is, Receiver~1 wishes to
estimate the first source component and Receiver~2 wishes to estimate the
second source component. Our interest is in the pairs of expected squared-error
distortions that are simultaneously achievable at the two receivers.
  We prove that an uncoded transmission scheme that sends a linear combination
of the source components achieves the optimal power-versus-distortion trade-off
whenever the signal-to-noise ratio is below a certain threshold. The threshold
is a function of the source correlation and the distortion at the receiver with
the weaker noise.

  (RANLP 2007). Borovets, Bulgaria: INCOMA, 12-16</journal-ref><abstract>  Despite its importance, the task of summarizing evolving events has received
small attention by researchers in the field of multi-document summariztion. In
a previous paper (Afantenos et al. 2007) we have presented a methodology for
the automatic summarization of documents, emitted by multiple sources, which
describe the evolution of an event. At the heart of this methodology lies the
identification of similarities and differences between the various documents,
in two axes: the synchronic and the diachronic. This is achieved by the
introduction of the notion of Synchronic and Diachronic Relations. Those
relations connect the messages that are found in the documents, resulting thus
in a graph which we call grid. Although the creation of the grid completes the
Document Planning phase of a typical NLG architecture, it can be the case that
the number of messages contained in a grid is very large, exceeding thus the
required compression rate. In this paper we provide some initial thoughts on a
probabilistic model which can be applied at the Content Determination stage,
and which tries to alleviate this problem.

still considered somewhat mysterious in many respects in quantum mechanics. At
successive stages mathematical theory of measure, metrology and measurement
theory tried to systematize this field but significant questions remain open
about the nature of measurement, about the characterization of the observer,
about the reliability of measurement processes etc. The present paper attempts
to talk about these questions through the information science. We start from
the idea, rather common and intuitive, that the measurement process basically
acquires information. Next we expand this idea through four formal definitions
and infer some corollaries regarding the measurement process from those
definitions. Relativity emerges as the basic property of measurement from the
present logical framework and this rather surprising result collides with the
feeling of physicists who take measurement as a myth. In the closing this paper
shows how the measurement relativity wholly consists with some effects
calculated in QM and in Einstein's theory.

input elements. The client wants to privately compute the intersection of these
two sets: he learns which elements he has in common with the server (and
nothing more), while the server gains no information at all. In certain
applications it would be useful to have a private matching protocol that
reports a match even if two elements are only similar instead of equal. Such a
private matching protocol is called \emph{fuzzy}, and is useful, for instance,
when elements may be inaccurate or corrupted by errors.
  We consider the fuzzy private matching problem, in a semi-honest environment.
Elements are similar if they match on $t$ out of $T$ attributes. First we show
that the original solution proposed by Freedman et al. is incorrect.
Subsequently we present two fuzzy private matching protocols. The first,
simple, protocol has bit message complexity $O(n \binom{T}{t} (T
\log{|D|}+k))$. The second, improved, protocol has a much better bit message
complexity of $O(n T (\log{|D|}+k))$, but here the client incurs a O(n) factor
time complexity. Additionally, we present protocols based on the computation of
the Hamming distance and on oblivious transfer, that have different, sometimes
more efficient, performance characteristics.

task. However, for a certain type of (sufficiently) good codes an efficient
decoding algorithm with near optimal performance exists. These codes are
defined via a combination of constituent codes with low complexity trellis
representations. Their decoding algorithm is an instance of (loopy) belief
propagation and is based on an iterative transfer of constituent beliefs. The
beliefs are thereby given by the symbol probabilities computed in the
constituent trellises. Even though weak constituent codes are employed close to
optimal performance is obtained, i.e., the encoder/decoder pair (almost)
achieves the information theoretic capacity. However, (loopy) belief
propagation only performs well for a rather specific set of codes, which limits
its applicability.
  In this paper a generalisation of iterative decoding is presented. It is
proposed to transfer more values than just the constituent beliefs. This is
achieved by the transfer of beliefs obtained by independently investigating
parts of the code space. This leads to the concept of discriminators, which are
used to improve the decoder resolution within certain areas and defines
discriminated symbol beliefs. It is shown that these beliefs approximate the
overall symbol probabilities. This leads to an iteration rule that (below
channel capacity) typically only admits the solution of the overall decoding
problem. Via a Gauss approximation a low complexity version of this algorithm
is derived. Moreover, the approach may then be applied to a wide range of
channel maps without significant complexity increase.

  Game</title><categories>cs.CE</categories><comments>28 pages, 4 figures</comments><abstract>  We consider the problem of Adverse Selection and optimal derivative design
within a Principal-Agent framework. The principal's income is exposed to
non-hedgeable risk factors arising, for instance, from weather or climate
phenomena. She evaluates her risk using a coherent and law invariant risk
measure and tries minimize her exposure by selling derivative securities on her
income to individual agents. The agents have mean-variance preferences with
heterogeneous risk aversion coefficients. An agent's degree of risk aversion is
private information and hidden to the principal who only knows the overall
distribution. We show that the principal's risk minimization problem has a
solution and illustrate the effects of risk transfer on her income by means of
two specific examples. Our model extends earlier work of Barrieu and El Karoui
(2005) and Carlier, Ekeland and Touzi (2007).

represented into Time Series using the operators inside programming languages

that represent similar code instructions. In contrast with other code

that two source codes are similar when their respective Time Series are

  Rates Approaching the Slepian-Wolf Bound</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to European Transactions in Telecommunications, July 2007</comments><abstract>  This article proposes a novel iterative algorithm based on Low Density Parity
Check (LDPC) codes for compression of correlated sources at rates approaching
the Slepian-Wolf bound. The setup considered in the article looks at the
problem of compressing one source at a rate determined based on the knowledge
of the mean source correlation at the encoder, and employing the other
correlated source as side information at the decoder which decompresses the
first source based on the estimates of the actual correlation. We demonstrate
that depending on the extent of the actual source correlation estimated through
an iterative paradigm, significant compression can be obtained relative to the
case the decoder does not use the implicit knowledge of the existence of
correlation.

aspects: The system models are structured, often as products of components, and
the specification logic has to be expressive enough to allow the formalization
of reachability properties. The present paper is a study on what can be
achieved for infinite transition systems under these premises. As models we
consider products of infinite transition systems with different synchronization
constraints. We introduce finitely synchronized transition systems, i.e.
product systems which contain only finitely many (parameterized) synchronized
transitions, and show that the decidability of FO(R), first-order logic
extended by reachability predicates, of the product system can be reduced to
the decidability of FO(R) of the components. This result is optimal in the
following sense: (1) If we allow semifinite synchronization, i.e. just in one
component infinitely many transitions are synchronized, the FO(R)-theory of the
product system is in general undecidable. (2) We cannot extend the expressive
power of the logic under consideration. Already a weak extension of first-order
logic with transitive closure, where we restrict the transitive closure
operators to arity one and nesting depth two, is undecidable for an
asynchronous (and hence finitely synchronized) product, namely for the infinite
grid.

electromagnetic waves requires quantum-mechanical analysis to properly account
for the bosonic nature of these waves. Recent work has established capacity
theorems for bosonic single-user, broadcast, and wiretap channels, under the
presumption of two minimum output entropy conjectures. Despite considerable
accumulated evidence that supports the validity of these conjectures, they have
yet to be proven. Here we show that the preceding minimum output entropy
conjectures are simple consequences of an Entropy Photon-Number Inequality,
which is a conjectured quantum-mechanical analog of the Entropy Power
Inequality (EPI) from classical information theory.

generation of Web sites that allow users to create and share content. Sites
such as Digg, Flickr, and Del.icio.us allow users to designate others as
&quot;friends&quot; or &quot;contacts&quot; and provide a single-click interface to track friends'
activity. How are these social networks used? Unlike pure social networking
sites (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook), which allow users to articulate their
online professional and personal relationships, social media sites are not, for
the most part, aimed at helping users create or foster online relationships.
Instead, we claim that social media users create social networks to express
their tastes and interests, and use them to filter the vast stream of new
submissions to find interesting content. Social networks, in fact, facilitate
new ways of interacting with information: what we call social browsing. Through
an extensive analysis of data from Digg and Flickr, we show that social
browsing is one of the primary usage modalities on these social media sites.
This finding has implications for how social media sites rate and personalize
content.

  Communication Networks</comments><acm-class>C.2.1</acm-class><abstract>  In this paper, we derive the optimal transmitter/ receiver beamforming
vectors and relay weighting matrix for the multiple-input multiple-output
amplify-and-forward relay channel. The analysis is accomplished in two steps.
In the first step, the direct link between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver
(Rx) is ignored and we show that the transmitter and the relay should map their
signals to the strongest right singular vectors of the Tx-relay and relay-Rx
channels. Based on the distributions of these vectors for independent
identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh channels, the Grassmannian codebooks
are used for quantizing and sending back the channel information to the
transmitter and the relay. The simulation results show that even a few number
of bits can considerably increase the link reliability in terms of bit error
rate. For the second step, the direct link is considered in the problem model
and we derive the optimization problem that identifies the optimal Tx
beamforming vector. For the i.i.d Rayleigh channels, we show that the solution
to this problem is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere and we justify the
appropriateness of the Grassmannian codebook (for determining the optimal
beamforming vector), both analytically and by simulation. Finally, a modified
quantizing scheme is presented which introduces a negligible degradation in the
system performance but significantly reduces the required number of feedback
bits.

Control Protocol (RCP) operating with small buffers. We first tackle the issue
of stability for networks with arbitrary topologies. We prove that the max-min
fair RCP fluid model is globally stable in the absence of propagation delays,
and also derive a set of conditions for local stability when arbitrary
heterogeneous propagation delays are present. The network delay stability
result assumes that, at equilibrium, there is only one bottleneck link along
each route. Lastly, in the simpler setting of a single link, single delay
model, we investigate the impact of the loss of local stability via a Hopf
bifurcation.

from group rings. They consist primarily of two types: zero-divisor and
unit-derived codes. Previous codes from group rings focused on ideals; for
example cyclic codes are ideals in the group ring over a cyclic group. The
fresh focus is on the encodings themselves, which only under very limited
conditions result in ideals. We use the result that a group ring is isomorphic
to a certain well-defined ring of matrices, and thus every group ring element
has an associated matrix. This allows matrix algebra to be used as needed in
the study and production of codes, enabling the creation of standard generator
and check matrices. Group rings are a fruitful source of units and
zero-divisors from which new codes result. Many code properties, such as being
LDPC or self-dual, may be expressed as properties within the group ring thus
enabling the construction of codes with these properties. The methods are
general enabling the construction of codes with many types of group rings.
There is no restriction on the ring and thus codes over the integers, over
matrix rings or even over group rings themselves are possible and fruitful.

  Programming Environments (WLPE2007)</comments><acm-class>D.2.6; D.1.6</acm-class><abstract>  Making a Prolog program more efficient by transforming its source code,
without changing its operational semantics, is not an obvious task. It requires
the user to have a clear understanding of how the Prolog compiler works, and in
particular, of the effects of impure features like the cut. The way a Prolog
code is written - e.g., the order of clauses, the order of literals in a
clause, the use of cuts or negations - influences its efficiency. Furthermore,
different optimization techniques may be redundant or conflicting when they are
applied together, depending on the way a procedure is called - e.g., inserting
cuts and enabling indexing. We present an optimiser, based on abstract
interpretation, that automatically performs safe code transformations of Prolog
procedures in the context of some class of input calls. The method is more
effective if procedures are annotated with additional information about modes,
types, sharing, number of solutions and the like. Thus the approach is similar
to Mercury. It applies to any Prolog program, however.

coroutining. This introduces a class of bug symptoms -- computations can
flounder when they are intended to succeed or finitely fail. For concurrent
logic programs this is normally called deadlock. Similarly, constraint logic
programs can fail to invoke certain constraint solvers because variables are
insufficiently instantiated or constrained. Diagnosing such faults has received
relatively little attention to date. Since delay primitives affect the
procedural but not the declarative view of programs, it may be expected that
debugging would have to consider the often complex details of interleaved
execution. However, recent work on semantics has suggested an alternative
approach. In this paper we show how the declarative debugging paradigm can be
used to diagnose unexpected floundering, insulating the user from the
complexities of the execution.

exists a $(1+\epsilon)t(k)$-spanner for $P$ that has $O(|P|)$ edges and
chromatic number at most $k$. Finally, we consider an on-line variant of the
problem where the points of $P$ are given one after another, and the color of a
point must be assigned at the moment the point is given. In this setting, we
prove that $t(2) = 3$, $t(3) = 1+ \sqrt{3}$, $t(4) = 1+ \sqrt{2}$, and give
upper and lower bounds on $t(k)$ for $k&gt;4$.

modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved
efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms
traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first
glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious
to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial
is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph
Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral
clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several
different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral
clustering algorithms are discussed.

DMCs is investigated. This study complements recent results showing how limited
or noisy feedback can boost the reliability of communication. A strategy with
fixed input distribution $P$ is given that asymptotically achieves rates
arbitrarily close to the mutual information induced by $P$ and the
state-averaged channel. When the capacity achieving input distribution is the
same over all channel states, this achieves rates at least as large as the
capacity of the state averaged channel, sometimes called the empirical
capacity.

acyclic graph with n vertices, under an online edge insertion sequence of m
edges. Efficient algorithms for online topological ordering have many
applications, including online cycle detection, which is to discover the first
edge that introduces a cycle under an arbitrary sequence of edge insertions in
a directed graph. In this paper we present efficient algorithms for the online
topological ordering problem.
  We first present a simple algorithm with running time O(n^{5/2}) for the
online topological ordering problem. This is the current fastest algorithm for
this problem on dense graphs, i.e., when m &gt; n^{5/3}. We then present an
algorithm with running time O((m + nlog n)\sqrt{m}); this is more efficient for
sparse graphs. Our results yield an improved upper bound of O(min(n^{5/2}, (m +
nlog n)sqrt{m})) for the online topological ordering problem.

of players in the sponsored search market. We report a 3-fold diversification
triggered by two inherent features of the sponsored search market, namely,
capacity constraints and collusion-vulnerability of current mechanisms. In the
first scenario, we present a comparative study of two models motivated by
capacity constraints - one where the additional capacity is provided by
for-profit agents, who compete for slots in the original auction, draw traffic,
and run their own sub-auctions, and the other, where the additional capacity is
provided by the auctioneer herself, by essentially acting as a mediator and
running a single combined auction. This study was initiated by us in
\cite{SRGR07}, where the mediator-based model was studied. In the present work,
we study the auctioneer-based model and show that this model seems inferior to
the mediator-based model in terms of revenue or efficiency guarantee due to
added capacity. In the second scenario, we initiate a game theoretic study of
current sponsored search auctions, involving incentive driven mediators who
exploit the fact that these mechanisms are not collusion-resistant. In
particular, we show that advertisers can improve their payoffs by using the
services of the mediator compared to directly participating in the auction, and
that the mediator can also obtain monetary benefit, without violating incentive
constraints from the advertisers who do not use its services. We also point out
that the auctioneer can not do very much via mechanism design to avoid such
for-profit mediation without losing badly in terms of revenue, and therefore,
the mediators are likely to prevail.

Wireless Communications, April 2008
  (initially submitted Nov. 2007). Results shown to apply to the exact outage
  probability/transmitter density, rather than to nearest neighbor bound</comments><abstract>  This paper addresses the following question, which is of interest in the
design of a multiuser decentralized network. Given a total system bandwidth of
W Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each transmission, how many
frequency slots N of size W/N should the band be partitioned into in order to
maximize the number of simultaneous links in the network? Dividing the
available spectrum results in two competing effects. On the positive side, a
larger N allows for more parallel, noninterfering communications to take place
in the same area. On the negative side, a larger N increases the SINR
requirement for each link because the same information rate must be achieved
over less bandwidth. Exploring this tradeoff and determining the optimum value
of N in terms of the system parameters is the focus of the paper. Using
stochastic geometry, the optimal SINR threshold - which directly corresponds to
the optimal spectral efficiency - is derived for both the low SNR
(power-limited) and high SNR (interference-limited) regimes. This leads to the
optimum choice of the number of frequency bands N in terms of the path loss
exponent, power and noise spectral density, desired rate, and total bandwidth.

  in Ultra High-Speed Networks</title><categories>cs.NI</categories><comments>9 pages, 8 figures</comments><acm-class>C.2.1</acm-class><abstract>  Advanced channel reservation is emerging as an important feature of ultra
high-speed networks requiring the transfer of large files. Applications include
scientific data transfers and database backup. In this paper, we present two
new, on-line algorithms for advanced reservation, called BatchAll and BatchLim,
that are guaranteed to achieve optimal throughput performance, based on
multi-commodity flow arguments. Both algorithms are shown to have
polynomial-time complexity and provable bounds on the maximum delay for
1+epsilon bandwidth augmented networks. The BatchLim algorithm returns the
completion time of a connection immediately as a request is placed, but at the
expense of a slightly looser competitive ratio than that of BatchAll. We also
present a simple approach that limits the number of parallel paths used by the
algorithms while provably bounding the maximum reduction factor in the
transmission throughput. We show that, although the number of different paths
can be exponentially large, the actual number of paths needed to approximate
the flow is quite small and proportional to the number of edges in the network.
Simulations for a number of topologies show that, in practice, 3 to 5 parallel
paths are sufficient to achieve close to optimal performance. The performance
of the competitive algorithms are also compared to a greedy benchmark, both
through analysis and simulation.

more than the starting LP-instance. These differences of the dual variables are

federated computational, storage and visualisation resources being available to
scientists and researchers. Distributed and heterogeneous nature of these
resources renders most of the legacy cluster monitoring and management
approaches inappropriate, and poses new challenges in workflow scheduling on
such systems. Effective resource utilisation monitoring and highly granular yet

architecture, a universal platform for delivering future high demand
computational services. Strong adoption of the Grid and the utility computing
concept is leading to an increasing number of Grid installations running a wide
range of applications of different size and complexity. In this paper we
address the problem of elivering deadline/economy based scheduling in a
heterogeneous application environment using statistical properties of job
historical executions and its associated meta-data. This approach is motivated
by a study of six-month computational load generated by Grid applications in a
multi-purpose Grid cluster serving a community of twenty e-Science projects.
The observed job statistics, resource utilisation and user behaviour is
discussed in the context of management approaches and models most suitable for
supporting a probabilistic and autonomous scheduling architecture.

of programming languages so as to minimise the hazards introduced by
error-prone features. This is realised by writing code that is constrained to a
subset of the a priori admissible programs, and that, moreover, may use only a
subset of the language. These subsets are determined by a collection of
so-called coding rules.

Prolog as the implementation language for the system: besides highlighting its
strengths, we also point out a few potential weaknesses, hinting at possible

in a declarative programming language. In order to ensure safe database
updates, all access and update operations related to the database are generated
from high-level descriptions in the entity- relationship (ER) model. We propose
a representation of ER diagrams in the declarative language Curry so that they
can be constructed by various tools and then translated into this
representation. Furthermore, we have implemented a compiler from this
representation into a Curry program that provides access and update operations
based on a high-level API for database programming.

unknown distribution. Our goal is to estimate the conditional expectation of
$X_{n+1}$ based on the observations $X_i$, $0\le i\le n$ in a strongly
consistent way. Bailey and Ryabko proved that this is not possible even for
ergodic binary time series if one estimates at all values of $n$. We propose a
very simple algorithm which will make prediction infinitely often at carefully
selected stopping times chosen by our rule. We show that under certain
conditions our procedure is strongly (pointwise) consistent, and $L_2$
consistent without any condition. An upper bound on the growth of the stopping
times is also presented in this paper.

universal for arbitrary computation (i.e. can compute any function with bounded
error), if all gates fail independently with probability epsilon and
epsilon&lt;theta, where theta is roughly 8.856%.
  We show that formulas built from gates with 2 inputs, in which each gate
fails with probability at least theta cannot be universal. Hence, there is a
threshold on the tolerable noise for formulas with 2-input gates and it is
theta. We conjecture that the same threshold also holds for circuits.

we prove that $O(L)$ (an asymptotically linear multiple of $L$) measurements
are necessary and sufficient if $L$ grows linearly as a function of $M$. This
improves on the existing literature that is mostly focused on variants of a
specific recovery algorithm based on convex programming, for which
$O(L\log(M-L))$ measurements are required. We also show that $O(L\log(M-L))$
measurements are required in the sublinear regime ($L = o(M)$).

Statist. 24 (1996), no. 1, 370--379</journal-ref><abstract>  The setting is a stationary, ergodic time series. The challenge is to
construct a sequence of functions, each based on only finite segments of the
past, which together provide a strongly consistent estimator for the
conditional probability of the next observation, given the infinite past.
Ornstein gave such a construction for the case that the values are from a
finite set, and recently Algoet extended the scheme to time series with
coordinates in a Polish space.
  The present study relates a different solution to the challenge. The
algorithm is simple and its verification is fairly transparent. Some extensions
to regression, pattern recognition, and on-line forecasting are mentioned.

If the stationary and ergodic process turns out to possess finite entropy rate
then $\lambda_n$ is upperbounded by a polynomial, eventually almost surely.

peg captures many pegs consecutively, this is called a sweep. We investigate
whether the game can end in a dramatic fashion, with one peg sweeping all
remaining pegs off the board. For triangular boards of side 6 and 8 (with 21
and 36 holes, respectively) the geometrically longest sweep can occur as the
final move in a game. On larger triangular boards, we demonstrate how to
construct solutions that finish with arbitrarily long sweeps. We also consider
the problem of finding solutions that minimize the total number of moves (where
a move is one or more consecutive jumps by the same peg).

partial channel state information at the transmitter in a precoded
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system. Conventional codebook
designs use Grassmannian packing, equiangular frames, vector quantization, or
Fourier based constructions. While the capacity and error rate performance of
conventional codebook constructions have been extensively investigated,
constructing these codebooks is notoriously difficult relying on techniques
such as nonlinear search or iterative algorithms. Further, the resulting
codebooks may not have a systematic structure to facilitate storage of the
codebook and low search complexity. In this paper, we propose a new systematic
codebook design based on Kerdock codes and mutually unbiased bases. The
proposed Kerdock codebook consists of multiple mutually unbiased unitary bases
matrices with quaternary entries and the identity matrix. We propose to derive
the beamforming and precoding codebooks from this base codebook, eliminating
the requirement to store multiple codebooks. The propose structure requires
little memory to store and, as we show, the quaternary structure facilitates
codeword search. We derive the chordal distance for two antenna and four
antenna codebooks, showing that the proposed codebooks compare favorably with
prior designs. Monte Carlo simulations are used to compare achievable rates and
error rates for different codebooks sizes.

planar parallel manipulators. It focuses on special points, referred to as cusp
points, which may appear on these curves. Cusp points play an important role in
the kinematic behavior of parallel manipulators since they make possible a
nonsingular change of assembly mode. The purpose of this study is twofold.
First, it exposes a method to compute joint space singular curves of 3-RPR
planar parallel manipulators. Second, it presents an algorithm for detecting
and computing all cusp points in the joint space of these same manipulators.

overall source code size. Being a valuable asset both in terms of verification
and documentation, the composition of a test suite needs to be well understood
in order to identify opportunities as well as weaknesses for further evolution.
In this paper, we argue that the visualization of structural characteristics is
a viable means to support the exploration of test suites. Thanks to general
agreement on a limited set of key test design principles, such visualizations
are relatively easy to interpret. In particular, we present visualizations that
support testers in (i) locating test cases; (ii) examining the relation between
test code and production code; and (iii) studying the composition of and
dependencies within test cases. By means of two case studies, we demonstrate
how visual patterns help to identify key test suite characteristics. This
approach forms the first step in assisting a developer to build up
understanding about test suites beyond code reading.

Starting point for PlDoc was minimal distraction from the programming task and
maximal immediate reward, attempting to seduce the programmer to use the
system. Minimal distraction is achieved using structured comments that are as
closely as possible related to common Prolog documentation practices. Immediate
reward is provided by a web interface powered from the Prolog development
environment that integrates searching and browsing application and system
documentation. When accessed from localhost, it is possible to go from
documentation shown in a browser to the source code displayed in the user's

gravitational $N$-body integrator, the workhorse of the {\tt starlab}
production environment for simulating dense stellar systems. The
parallelization strategy, called ``j-parallelization'', involves the partition
of the computational domain by distributing all particles in the system among
the available processors. Partial forces on the particles to be advanced are
calculated in parallel by their parent processors, and are then summed in a
final global operation. Once total forces are obtained, the computing elements
proceed to the computation of their particle trajectories. We report the
results of timing measurements on four different parallel computers, and
compare them with theoretical predictions. The computers employ either a
high-speed interconnect, a NUMA architecture to minimize the communication
overhead or are distributed in a grid. The code scales well in the domain
tested, which ranges from 1024 - 65536 stars on 1 - 128 processors, providing
satisfactory speedup. Running the production environment on a grid becomes
inefficient for more than 60 processors distributed across three sites.

origin of non-native speakers. The origin of non-native speakers could be
identified by a human listener based on the detection of typical pronunciations
for each nationality. Thus we suppose the existence of several phoneme
sequences that might allow the classification of the origin of non-native
speakers. Our new method is based on the extraction of discriminative sequences
of phonemes from a non-native English speech database. These sequences are used
to construct a probabilistic classifier for the speakers' origin. The existence
of discriminative phone sequences in non-native speech is a significant result
of this work. The system that we have developed achieved a significant correct
classification rate of 96.3% and a significant error reduction compared to some
other tested techniques.

formalized by Markov Decision Processes. We revisit the work of Bertsekas and
Ioffe, that introduced $\lambda$ Policy Iteration, a family of algorithms
parameterized by $\lambda$ that generalizes the standard algorithms Value
Iteration and Policy Iteration, and has some deep connections with the Temporal
Differences algorithm TD($\lambda$) described by Sutton and Barto. We deepen
the original theory developped by the authors by providing convergence rate
bounds which generalize standard bounds for Value Iteration described for
instance by Puterman. Then, the main contribution of this paper is to develop
the theory of this algorithm when it is used in an approximate form and show
that this is sound. Doing so, we extend and unify the separate analyses
developped by Munos for Approximate Value Iteration and Approximate Policy
Iteration. Eventually, we revisit the use of this algorithm in the training of
a Tetris playing controller as originally done by Bertsekas and Ioffe. We
provide an original performance bound that can be applied to such an
undiscounted control problem. Our empirical results are different from those of
Bertsekas and Ioffe (which were originally qualified as &quot;paradoxical&quot; and
&quot;intriguing&quot;), and much more conform to what one would expect from a learning
experiment. We discuss the possible reason for such a difference.

time-invariant deterministic feedback. The model we consider involves the use
of fixed length block codes. Our achievability result includes a proof of the
existence of a universal decoder for the family of finite-state channels with
feedback. As a consequence of our capacity result, we show that feedback does
not increase the capacity of the compound Gilbert-Elliot channel. Additionally,
we show that for a stationary and uniformly ergodic Markovian channel, if the
compound channel capacity is zero without feedback then it is zero with
feedback. Finally, we use our result on the finite-state channel to show that
the feedback capacity of the memoryless compound channel is given by
$\inf_{\theta} \max_{Q_X} I(X;Y|\theta)$.

  on Information Theory</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The problem of error control in random linear network coding is addressed
from a matrix perspective that is closely related to the subspace perspective
of K\&quot;otter and Kschischang. A large class of constant-dimension subspace codes
is investigated. It is shown that codes in this class can be easily constructed
from rank-metric codes, while preserving their distance properties. Moreover,
it is shown that minimum distance decoding of such subspace codes can be
reformulated as a generalized decoding problem for rank-metric codes where
partial information about the error is available. This partial information may
be in the form of erasures (knowledge of an error location but not its value)
and deviations (knowledge of an error value but not its location). Taking
erasures and deviations into account (when they occur) strictly increases the
error correction capability of a code: if $\mu$ erasures and $\delta$
deviations occur, then errors of rank $t$ can always be corrected provided that
$2t \leq d - 1 + \mu + \delta$, where $d$ is the minimum rank distance of the
code. For Gabidulin codes, an important family of maximum rank distance codes,
an efficient decoding algorithm is proposed that can properly exploit erasures
and deviations. In a network coding application where $n$ packets of length $M$
over $F_q$ are transmitted, the complexity of the decoding algorithm is given
by $O(dM)$ operations in an extension field $F_{q^n}$.

the author suggested that biovie-physical phenomenon as `electrodynamic
dependant biological vision', is governed by relativistic quantum laws and
biovision. The phenomenon on the basis of `biovielectroluminescence', satisfies
man/microbio/megabio/computer vision (MMMCV), as a robust candidate for
physical and visual sciences. The general aim of this addendum is to present a
refined text of Sections 1-3 of that proposal and highlighting the contents of
its Appendix in form of a `Mechanisms' Section. We then briefly remind in an
article aimed for December 2007, by appending two more equations into Section
3, a theoretical II-time scenario as a time model well-proposed for the
phenomenon. The time model within the core of the proposal, plays a significant
role in emphasizing the principle points on Objectives no. 1-8, Sub-hypothesis
3.1.2, mentioned in Article [arXiv:0710.0410]. It also expresses the time
concept in terms of causing quantized energy f(|E|) of time |t|, emit in regard
to shortening the probability of particle loci as predictable patterns of
particle's un-occurred motion, a solution to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
(HUP) into a simplistic manner. We conclude that, practical frames via a time
algorithm to this model, fixates such predictable patterns of motion of scenery
bodies onto recordable observation points of a MMMCV system. It even
suppresses/predicts superposition phenomena coming from a human subject and/or
other bio-subjects for any decision making event, e.g., brainwave quantum
patterns based on vision. Maintaining the existential probability of Riemann
surfaces of II-time scenarios in the context of biovielectroluminescence, makes
motion-prediction a possibility.

developed consists in associating to each spoken phone several sequences of
confused phones. In our experiments, we have used different combinations of
acoustic models representing the canonical and the foreign pronunciations:
spoken and native models, models adapted to the non-native accent with MAP and
MLLR. The joint use of pronunciation modelling and acoustic adaptation led to
further improvements in recognition accuracy. The best combination of the above
mentioned techniques resulted in a relative word error reduction ranging from
46% to 71%.

are jump instructions where the position of the instruction to jump to is the
content of some memory cell. We consider several kinds of indirect jump
instructions. For each kind, we define the meaning of programs with indirect
jump instructions of that kind by means of a translation into programs without
indirect jump instructions. For each kind, the intended behaviour of a program
with indirect jump instructions of that kind under execution is the behaviour
of the translated program under execution on interaction with some memory
device.

is that it allows for distinguishing between expectations and promises in
interfaces of process components. This distinction comes into play in case
components with both client and server behaviour are involved.

practitioner's view on what is a program: code that is capable of controlling
the behaviour of some machine. We present a logical approach to explain issues
concerning control codes that are independent of the details of the behaviours
that are controlled. Using this approach, such issues can be explained at a
very abstract level. We illustrate this among other things by means of an
example about the production of a new compiler from an existing one. The
approach is based on abstract machine models, called machine structures. We
introduce a model of systems that provide execution environments for the
executable codes of machine structures and use it to go into portability of
control codes.

the operating unit size, the cardinality of the instruction set, and the
maximal number of states of the threads.

between threads and services with features of molecular dynamics, a model of
computation that bears on computations in which dynamic data structures are
involved. Threads can interact with services of which the states consist of
structured data objects and computations take place by means of actions which
may change the structure of the data objects. The features introduced include
restriction of the scope of names used in threads to refer to data objects.
Because that feature makes it troublesome to provide a model based on
structural operational semantics and bisimulation, we construct a projective
limit model for the theory.

  Multi-Hop Wireless Networks</title><categories>cs.NI</categories><comments>Short version invited to INFOCOM 2008 mini-conference</comments><acm-class>C.2.2</acm-class><abstract>  In this paper we consider security-related and energy-efficiency issues in
multi-hop wireless networks. We start our work from the observation, known in
the literature, that shortest path routing creates congested areas in multi-hop
wireless networks. These areas are critical--they generate both security and
energy efficiency issues. We attack these problems and set out routing in outer
space, a new routing mechanism that transforms any shortest path routing
protocol (or approximated versions of it) into a new protocol that, in case of
uniform traffic, guarantees that every node of the network is responsible for
relaying the same number of messages, on expectation. We can show that a
network that uses routing in outer space does not have congested areas, does
not have the associated security-related issues, does not encourage selfish
positioning, and, in spite of using more energy globally, lives longer of the
same network using the original routing protocol.

either embedded or communicates using a proprietary protocol, we propose an
architecture where Prolog communicates to other components in a Web application
using the standard HTTP protocol. By avoiding embedding in external Web servers
development and deployment become much easier. To support this architecture, in
addition to the transfer protocol, we must also support parsing, representing
and generating the key Web document types such as HTML, XML and RDF.
  This paper motivates the design decisions in the libraries and extensions to
Prolog for handling Web documents and protocols. The design has been guided by
the requirement to handle large documents efficiently. The described libraries
support a wide range of Web applications ranging from HTML and XML documents to
Semantic Web RDF processing.

propositional dynamic logic (PDL) which builds a finite rooted tree with
ancestor loops and passes extra information from children to parents to
separate good loops from bad loops during backtracking. It is easy to
implement, with potential for parallelisation, because it constructs a
pseudo-model ``on the fly'' by exploring each tableau branch independently. But
its worst-case behaviour is 2EXPTIME rather than EXPTIME. A prototype
implementation in the TWB (http://twb.rsise.anu.edu.au) is available.

  et Applications (2007)</journal-ref><abstract>  In this article, we present an approach for non native automatic speech
recognition (ASR). We propose two methods to adapt existing ASR systems to the
non-native accents. The first method is based on the modification of acoustic
models through integration of acoustic models from the mother tong. The
phonemes of the target language are pronounced in a similar manner to the
native language of speakers. We propose to combine the models of confused
phonemes so that the ASR system could recognize both concurrent
pronounciations. The second method we propose is a refinment of the
pronounciation error detection through the introduction of graphemic
constraints. Indeed, non native speakers may rely on the writing of words in
their uttering. Thus, the pronounctiation errors might depend on the characters
composing the words. The average error rate reduction that we observed is
(22.5%) relative for the sentence error rate, and 34.5% (relative) in word
error rate.

  Binary Erasure Channe</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to the IEEE Trans. on Information Theory, November 7th,
  2007</comments><abstract>  This paper provides simple lower bounds on the number of iterations which is
required for successful message-passing decoding of some important families of
graph-based code ensembles (including low-density parity-check codes and
variations of repeat-accumulate codes). The transmission of the code ensembles
is assumed to take place over a binary erasure channel, and the bounds refer to
the asymptotic case where we let the block length tend to infinity. The
simplicity of the bounds derived in this paper stems from the fact that they
are easily evaluated and are expressed in terms of some basic parameters of the
ensemble which include the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes, the target bit
erasure probability and the gap between the channel capacity and the design
rate of the ensemble. This paper demonstrates that the number of iterations
which is required for successful message-passing decoding scales at least like
the inverse of the gap (in rate) to capacity, provided that the fraction of
degree-2 variable nodes of these turbo-like ensembles does not vanish (hence,
the number of iterations becomes unbounded as the gap to capacity vanishes).

Rayleigh fading $M_t \times M_r$ MIMO channel when the channel state
information is only available at the receiver. Since the channel is not
ergodic, Shannon's source-channel separation theorem becomes obsolete and the
optimal performance requires a joint source -channel approach. Our goal is to
minimize the expected end-to-end distortion, particularly in the high SNR
regime. The figure of merit is the distortion exponent, defined as the
exponential decay rate of the expected distortion with increasing SNR. We
provide an upper bound and lower bounds for the distortion exponent with
respect to the bandwidth ratio among the channel and source bandwidths. For the
lower bounds, we analyze three different strategies based on layered source
coding concatenated with progressive, superposition or hybrid digital/analog
transmission. In each case, by adjusting the system parameters we optimize the
distortion exponent as a function of the bandwidth ratio. We prove that the
distortion exponent upper bound can be achieved when the channel has only one
degree of freedom, that is L=1, and $\min\{M_t,M_r\}=1$. When we have more
degrees of freedom, our achievable distortion exponents meet the upper bound
for only certain ranges of the bandwidth ratio. We demonstrate that our
results, which were derived for a complex Gaussian source, can be extended to
more general source distributions as well.

Mathematics 17:627-682, 2011</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A &quot;clique minor&quot; in a graph G can be thought of as a set of connected
subgraphs in G that are pairwise disjoint and pairwise adjacent. The &quot;Hadwiger
number&quot; h(G) is the maximum cardinality of a clique minor in G. This paper
studies clique minors in the Cartesian product G*H.
  Our main result is a rough structural characterisation theorem for Cartesian
products with bounded Hadwiger number. It implies that if the product of two
sufficiently large graphs has bounded Hadwiger number then it is one of the
following graphs:
  - a planar grid with a vortex of bounded width in the outerface,
  - a cylindrical grid with a vortex of bounded width in each of the two `big'
faces, or
  - a toroidal grid.
  Motivation for studying the Hadwiger number of a graph includes Hadwiger's
Conjecture, which states that the chromatic number chi(G) &lt;= h(G). It is open
whether Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for every Cartesian product. We prove that
if |V(H)|-1 &gt;= chi(G) &gt;= chi(H) then Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for G*H. On
the other hand, we prove that Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for all Cartesian
products if and only if it holds for all G * K_2. We then show that h(G * K_2)
is tied to the treewidth of G.
  We also develop connections with pseudoachromatic colourings and connected
dominating sets that imply near-tight bounds on the Hadwiger number of grid
graphs (Cartesian products of paths) and Hamming graphs (Cartesian products of
cliques).

collection was based on observations (by the cognitive ergonomics researcher)
and simultaneous verbalisations (by the designers) in empirical studies
conducted in the context of industrial design projects. The contribution of
this research is typical of cognitive ergonomics, in that it provides data on
actual activities implemented by designers in their actual work situation
(rather than on prescribed and/or idealised processes and methods). Data
presented concern global strategies (the way in which designers actually
organise their activity) and local strategies (reuse in design). Results from
cognitive ergonomics and other research that challenges the way in which people
are supposed to work with existing systems are generally not received warmly.
Abundant corroboration of such results is required before industry may consider
taking them into account. The opportunistic organisation of design activity is
taken here as an example of this reluctance. The results concerning this aspect
of design have been verified repeatedly, but only prototypes and experimental
systems implementing some of the requirements formulated on their basis, are
under development.

on cognitive, dynamic aspects of real design, i.e., the actual cognitive
activity implemented by designers during their work on professional design
projects. Rather than conceiving de-signing as problem solving - Simon's
symbolic information processing (SIP) approach - or as a reflective practice or
some other form of situated activity - the situativity (SIT) approach - we
consider that, from a cognitive viewpoint, designing is most appropriately
characterised as a construction of representations. After a critical discussion
of the SIP and SIT approaches to design, we present our view-point. This
presentation concerns the evolving nature of representations regarding levels
of abstraction and degrees of precision, the function of external
representations, and specific qualities of representation in collective design.
Designing is described at three levels: the organisation of the activity, its
strategies, and its design-representation construction activities (different
ways to generate, trans-form, and evaluate representations). Even if we adopt a
&quot;generic design&quot; stance, we claim that design can take different forms
depending on the nature of the artefact, and we propose some candidates for
dimensions that allow a distinction to be made between these forms of design.
We discuss the potential specificity of HCI design, and the lack of cognitive
design research occupied with the quality of design. We close our discussion of
representational structures and activities by an outline of some directions
regarding their functional linkages.

even for simple application patterns such as pipeline graphs. The problem is
even more complex when processors are subject to failure during the execution
of the application. In this paper, we study the complexity of a bi-criteria
mapping which aims at optimizing the latency (i.e., the response time) and the
reliability (i.e., the probability that the computation will be successful) of
the application. Latency is minimized by using faster processors, while
reliability is increased by replicating computations on a set of processors.
However, replication increases latency (additional communications, slower
processors). The application fails to be executed only if all the processors
fail during execution. While simple polynomial algorithms can be found for
fully homogeneous platforms, the problem becomes NP-hard when tackling
heterogeneous platforms. This is yet another illustration of the additional
complexity added by heterogeneity.

quantity of flow to be routed through a network, and are able to split their
own flow between multiple paths through the network. Recent work on this model
has contrasted the social cost of Nash equilibria with the best possible social
cost. Here we show that additional costs are incurred in situations where a
selfish ``leader'' agent allocates his flow, and then commits to that choice so
that other agents are compelled to minimise their own cost based on the first
agent's choice. We find that even in simple networks, the leader can often
improve his own cost at the expense of increased social cost. Focusing on the
2-player case, we give upper and lower bounds on the worst-case additional cost
incurred.

proportional fairness of long term received rates of data users and quality of
service for real time sessions in an OFDMA-based wireless system. The base
station allocates available power and bandwidth to individual users based on
long term average received rates, QoS based rate constraints and channel

propose an algorithm that achieves the optimal allocation. Numerical evaluation
results show that the proposed algorithm provides better QoS to voice and video

individual and collective form. It focuses on collective design with respect to
individual design. The theoretical framework adopted is that of information
processing, specified for design problems. The cognitive characteristics of
design problems are presented: the effects of their ill-defined character and
of the different types of representation implemented in solving these problems,
amongst others the more or less &quot;satisficing&quot; character of the different
possible solutions. The text first describes the cognitive activities
implemented in both individual and collective design: different types of
control activities and of the executive activities of solution development and
evaluation. Specific collective-design characteristics are then presented:
co-design and distributed-design activities, temporo-operative and cognitive
synchronisation, and different types of argumentation, of co-designers'
intervention modes in the design process, of solution-proposals evaluation. The
paper concludes by a confrontation between the two types of design, individual
and collective.

in \cite{Hong06} for a high rate $2\times 2$ multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) system over slow fading channels. In this letter, we present the
performance analysis of GST-TCM over block fading channels, where the channel
matrix is constant over a fraction of the codeword length and varies from one
fraction to another, independently. In practice, it is not useful to design
such codes for specific block fading channel parameters and a robust solution
is preferable. We then show both analytically and by simulation that the
GST-TCM designed for slow fading channels are indeed robust to all block fading
channel conditions.

and preliminarily studied. Connections with replicator dynamics and diffusion
processes are pointed out. The stability of the dominance state, where most of
the population speaks a single language, is analyzed within a mean-field-like
approximation, while the homogeneous state, where the population is evenly
distributed among languages, can be exactly studied. This analysis discloses
the existence of a bistability region, where dominance coexists with
homogeneity as possible asymptotic states. Numerical resolution of the
differential system validates these findings.

  figures</comments><abstract>  A tree decomposition of the coordinates of a code is a mapping from the
coordinate set to the set of vertices of a tree. A tree decomposition can be
extended to a tree realization, i.e., a cycle-free realization of the code on
the underlying tree, by specifying a state space at each edge of the tree, and
a local constraint code at each vertex of the tree. The constraint complexity
of a tree realization is the maximum dimension of any of its local constraint
codes. A measure of the complexity of maximum-likelihood decoding for a code is
its treewidth, which is the least constraint complexity of any of its tree
realizations.
  It is known that among all tree realizations of a code that extends a given
tree decomposition, there exists a unique minimal realization that minimizes
the state space dimension at each vertex of the underlying tree. In this paper,
we give two new constructions of these minimal realizations. As a by-product of
the first construction, a generalization of the state-merging procedure for
trellis realizations, we obtain the fact that the minimal tree realization also
minimizes the local constraint code dimension at each vertex of the underlying
tree. The second construction relies on certain code decomposition techniques
that we develop. We further observe that the treewidth of a code is related to
a measure of graph complexity, also called treewidth. We exploit this
connection to resolve a conjecture of Forney's regarding the gap between the
minimum trellis constraint complexity and the treewidth of a code. We present a
family of codes for which this gap can be arbitrarily large.

Learning is currently limited -- in the former field, by the improbability of
making advantageous extensions to evolutionary algorithms when their capacity
for adaptation is poorly understood, and in the latter by the difficulty of
finding effective semi-principled reductions of hard real-world problems to
relatively simple optimization problems. In this paper we explain why a theory
which can accurately explain the simple genetic algorithm's remarkable capacity
for adaptation has the potential to address both these limitations. We describe
what we believe to be the impediments -- historic and analytic -- to the
discovery of such a theory and highlight the negative role that the building
block hypothesis (BBH) has played. We argue based on experimental results that
a fundamental limitation which is widely believed to constrain the SGA's
adaptive ability (and is strongly implied by the BBH) is in fact illusionary
and does not exist. The SGA therefore turns out to be more powerful than it is
currently thought to be. We give conditions under which it becomes feasible to
numerically approximate and study the multivariate marginals of the search
distribution of an infinite population SGA over multiple generations even when
its genomes are long, and explain why this analysis is relevant to the riddle
of the SGA's remarkable adaptive abilities.

records of the social interaction, and is the clue to the persons in the
underlying social network who do not appear in the records. This contribution
addresses a problem to predict relevant empty spots in social interaction.
Homogeneous and inhomogeneous networks are studied as a model underlying the
social interaction. A heuristic predictor function approach is presented as a
new method to address the problem. Simulation experiment is demonstrated over a
homogeneous network. A test data in the form of baskets is generated from the
simulated communication. Precision to predict the empty spots is calculated to
demonstrate the performance of the presented approach.

prove a kind of constructive Borel-Cantelli lemma: given a sequence
(constructive in some way) of sets $A_{i}$ with effectively summable measures,
there are computable points which are not contained in infinitely many $A_{i}$.
  As a consequence of this we obtain the existence of computable points which
follow the \emph{typical statistical behavior} of a dynamical system (they
satisfy the Birkhoff theorem) for a large class of systems, having computable
invariant measure and a certain ``logarithmic'' speed of convergence of
Birkhoff averages over Lipshitz observables. This is applied to uniformly
hyperbolic systems, piecewise expanding maps, systems on the interval with an
indifferent fixed point and it directly implies the existence of computable
numbers which are normal with respect to any base.

logically interconnected data. Through knowledge models such as Resource
Description Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web provides a unifying
representation of richly structured data. Adding logic to the Web implies the
use of rules to make inferences, choose courses of action, and answer
questions. This logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of
objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to
consider a paradox. The Web has several characteristics that can lead to
problems when existing logics are used, in particular, the inconsistencies that
inevitably arise due to the openness of the Web, where anyone can assert
anything. N3Logic is a logic that allows rules to be expressed in a Web
environment. It extends RDF with syntax for nested graphs and quantified
variables and with predicates for implication and accessing resources on the
Web, and functions including cryptographic, string, math. The main goal of
N3Logic is to be a minimal extension to the RDF data model such that the same
language can be used for logic and data. In this paper, we describe N3Logic and
illustrate through examples why it is an appropriate logic for the Web.

  Theory</comments><abstract>  The problem of channel code design for the $M$-ary input AWGN channel with
additive $Q$-ary interference where the sequence of i.i.d. interference symbols
is known causally at the encoder is considered. The code design criterion at
high SNR is derived by defining a new distance measure between the input
symbols of the Shannon's \emph{associated} channel. For the case of
binary-input channel, i.e., M=2, it is shown that it is sufficient to use only
two (out of $2^Q$) input symbols of the \emph{associated} channel in the
encoding as far as the distance spectrum of code is concerned. This reduces the
problem of channel code design for the binary-input AWGN channel with known
interference at the encoder to design of binary codes for the binary symmetric
channel where the Hamming distance among codewords is the major factor in the
performance of the code.

  Economy</title><categories>cs.GT</categories><comments>12 pages</comments><abstract>  The auction theory literature has so far focused mostly on the design of
mechanisms that takes the revenue or the efficiency as a yardstick. However,
scenarios where the {\it capacity}, which we define as \textit{``the number of
bidders the auctioneer wants to have a positive probability of getting the
item''}, is a fundamental concern are ubiquitous in the information economy.
For instance, in sponsored search auctions (SSA's) or in online ad-exchanges,
the true value of an ad-slot for an advertiser is inherently derived from the
conversion-rate, which in turn depends on whether the advertiser actually
obtained the ad-slot or not; thus, unless the capacity of the underlying
auction is large, key parameters, such as true valuations and
advertiser-specific conversion rates, will remain unknown or uncertain leading
to inherent inefficiencies in the system. In general, the same holds true for
all information goods/digital goods. We initiate a study of mechanisms, which
take capacity as a yardstick, in addition to revenue/efficiency. We show that
in the case of a single indivisible item one simple way to incorporate capacity
constraints is via designing mechanisms to sell probability distributions, and
that under certain conditions, such optimal probability distributions could be
identified using a Linear programming approach. We define a quantity called
{\it price of capacity} to capture the tradeoff between capacity and
revenue/efficiency. We also study the case of sponsored search auctions.
Finally, we discuss how general such an approach via probability spikes can be
made, and potential directions for future investigations.

  Information</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</comments><abstract>  This paper investigates downlink transmission over a quasi-static fading
Gaussian broadcast channel (BC), to model delay-sensitive applications over
slowly time-varying fading channels. System performance is characterized by
outage achievable rate regions. In contrast to most previous work, here the
problem is studied under the key assumption that the transmitter only knows the
probability distributions of the fading coefficients, but not their
realizations. For scalar-input channels, two coding schemes are proposed. The
first scheme is called blind dirty paper coding (B-DPC), which utilizes a
robustness property of dirty paper coding to perform precoding at the
transmitter. The second scheme is called statistical superposition coding
(S-SC), in which each receiver adaptively performs successive decoding with the
process statistically governed by the realized fading. Both B-DPC and S-SC
schemes lead to the same outage achievable rate region, which always dominates
that of time-sharing, irrespective of the particular fading distributions. The
S-SC scheme can be extended to BCs with multiple transmit antennas.

variant of the problem of efficiently maintaining dynamic rooted trees. This
variant requires merging two paths in a single operation. In contrast to the
standard problem, in which only one tree arc changes at a time, a single merge
operation can change many arcs. In spite of this, we develop a data structure
that supports merges on an n-node forest in O(log^2 n) amortized time and all
other standard tree operations in O(log n) time (amortized, worst-case, or
randomized depending on the underlying data structure). For the special case
that occurs in the motivating application, in which arbitrary arc deletions
(cuts) are not allowed, we give a data structure with an O(log n) time bound
per operation. This is asymptotically optimal under certain assumptions. For
the even-more special case in which both cuts and parent queries are
disallowed, we give an alternative O(log n)-time solution that uses standard
dynamic trees as a black box. This solution also applies to the motivating
application. Our methods use previous work on dynamic trees in various ways,
but the analysis of each algorithm requires novel ideas. We also investigate
lower bounds for the problem under various assumptions.

transformed into calculating the permanent of a matrix obtained from the
extended bipartite graph by Yan Huo, and Rasmussen presents a simple approach
(RM) to approximate the permanent, which just yields a critical ratio
O($n\omega(n)$) for almost all the 0-1 matrices, provided it's a simple
promising practical way to compute this #P-complete problem. In this paper, the
performance of this method will be shown when it's applied to compute all the
matchings based on that transformation. The critical ratio will be proved to be
very large with a certain probability, owning an increasing factor larger than
any polynomial of $n$ even in the sense for almost all the 0-1 matrices. Hence,
RM fails to work well when counting all the matchings via computing the
permanent of the matrix. In other words, we must carefully utilize the known
methods of estimating the permanent to count all the matchings through that
transformation.

  (2006) 149-154</journal-ref><abstract>  The paper proposes a novel calibration approach for the Orthoglide-type
mechanisms based on observations of the manipulator leg parallelism during
mo-tions between the prespecified test postures. It employs a low-cost
measuring system composed of standard comparator indicators attached to the
universal magnetic stands. They are sequentially used for measuring the
deviation of the relevant leg location while the manipulator moves the TCP
along the Cartesian axes. Using the measured differences, the developed
algorithm estimates the joint offsets that are treated as the most essential
parameters to be adjusted. The sensitivity of the meas-urement methods and the
calibration accuracy are also studied. Experimental re-sults are presented that
demonstrate validity of the proposed calibration technique

stationary Gaussian source is given in terms of its power spectrum. This
formula naturally lends itself to a frequency domain &quot;test-channel&quot;
realization. We provide an alternative time-domain realization for the
rate-distortion function, based on linear prediction. This solution has some
interesting implications, including the optimality at all distortion levels of
pre/post filtered vector-quantized differential pulse code modulation (DPCM),
and a duality relationship with decision-feedback equalization (DFE) for
inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels.

numerical code is common. The definition of a numerical context means the
configuration of resources such as memory, processor load and communication
graph, with an evolving feature: the resources availability. A feature is often
missing: the adaptability. It is not predictable and the adaptable aspect is
essential. Without calling into question these implementations of these codes,
we create an adaptive use of these implementations. Because the execution has
to be driven by the availability of main resources, the components of a numeric
computation have to react when their context changes. This paper offers a new
architecture, a mobile computing architecture, based on mobile agents and
JavaSpace. At the end of this paper, we apply our architecture to several case
studies and obtain our first results.

  Logic Programming</title><categories>cs.AI cs.LG</categories><comments>30 pages, 6 figures</comments><abstract>  Building rules on top of ontologies is the ultimate goal of the logical layer
of the Semantic Web. To this aim an ad-hoc mark-up language for this layer is
currently under discussion. It is intended to follow the tradition of hybrid
knowledge representation and reasoning systems such as $\mathcal{AL}$-log that
integrates the description logic $\mathcal{ALC}$ and the function-free Horn
clausal language \textsc{Datalog}. In this paper we consider the problem of
automating the acquisition of these rules for the Semantic Web. We propose a
general framework for rule induction that adopts the methodological apparatus
of Inductive Logic Programming and relies on the expressive and deductive power
of $\mathcal{AL}$-log. The framework is valid whatever the scope of induction
(description vs. prediction) is. Yet, for illustrative purposes, we also
discuss an instantiation of the framework which aims at description and turns
out to be useful in Ontology Refinement.

this paper, we study the three-color and two-color Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle
problems (3-TRP and 2-TRP) and their variants. Restricting the number of
allowed colors to three (respectively, to two) reduces the set of available
Tantrix(TM) tiles from 56 to 14 (respectively, to 8). We prove that 3-TRP and
2-TRP are NP-complete, which answers a question raised by Holzer and Holzer in
the affirmative. Since our reductions are parsimonious, it follows that the
problems Unique-3-TRP and Unique-2-TRP are DP-complete under randomized
reductions. We also show that the another-solution problems associated with
4-TRP, 3-TRP, and 2-TRP are NP-complete. Finally, we prove that the infinite
variants of 3-TRP and 2-TRP are undecidable.

A unified framework is introduced that permits the geometric characterization
of fading by incorporating the fading process into the point process model.
Concretely, assuming nodes are distributed in a stationary Poisson point
process in $\R^d$, the properties of the point processes that describe the path
loss with fading are analyzed. The main applications are connectivity and

  a-priori information</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>21 pages, 9 figures</comments><abstract>  In this article we focus on the problem of channel decoding in presence of
a-priori information. In particular, assuming that the a-priori information
reliability is not perfectly estimated at the receiver, we derive a novel
analytical framework for evaluating the decoder's performance. It is derived
the important result that a &quot;good code&quot;, i.e., a code which allows to fully
exploit the potential benefit of a-priori information, must associate
information sequences with high Hamming weights to codewords with low Hamming
weights. Basing on the proposed analysis, we analyze the performance of
convolutional codes, random codes, and turbo codes. Moreover, we consider the
transmission of correlated binary sources from independent nodes, a problem
which has several practical applications, e.g. in the case of sensor networks.
In this context, we propose a very simple joint source-channel turbo decoding
scheme where each decoder works by exploiting a-priori information given by the
other decoder. In the case of block fading channels, it is shown that the
inherent correlation between information signals provide a form of
non-cooperative diversity, thus allowing joint source-channel decoding to
outperform separation-based schemes.

Value Decomposition (SVD), but they transcend the limitations of matrices
(second-order tensors). SVD is a powerful tool that has achieved impressive
results in information retrieval, collaborative filtering, computational
linguistics, computational vision, and other fields. However, SVD is limited to
two-dimensional arrays of data (two modes), and many potential applications
have three or more modes, which require higher-order tensor decompositions.
This paper evaluates four algorithms for higher-order tensor decomposition:
Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HO-SVD), Higher-Order Orthogonal
Iteration (HOOI), Slice Projection (SP), and Multislice Projection (MP). We
measure the time (elapsed run time), space (RAM and disk space requirements),
and fit (tensor reconstruction accuracy) of the four algorithms, under a
variety of conditions. We find that standard implementations of HO-SVD and HOOI
do not scale up to larger tensors, due to increasing RAM requirements. We
recommend HOOI for tensors that are small enough for the available RAM and MP
for larger tensors.

Demand in these networks is very volatile, and predictive techniques to plan

  Our key finding is that a random walk predictor performs best for
one-step-ahead forecasts, whereas ARIMA(1,1,0) and adaptive exponential
smoothing models perform better for two and three-step-ahead forecasts. A Monte
Carlo bootstrap test is proposed to evaluate the continuous prediction
performance of different models with arbitrary confidence and statistical
significance levels. Although the prediction results differ between the Tycoon
and PlanetLab networks, we observe very similar overall statistical properties,
such as volatility dynamics.

optimization technique for DOB is presented. A hybrid cost model is proposed to
estimate the cost and cardinality of basic and inferred facts. Cardinality and
cost of inferred facts are estimated using an adaptive sampling technique,
while techniques of traditional relational cost models are used for estimating
the cost of basic facts and conjunctive ontology queries. Finally, we implement
a dynamic-programming optimization algorithm to identify query evaluation plans
that minimize the number of intermediate inferred facts. We modeled a subset of
the Web ontology language OWL Lite as a DOB, and performed an experimental
study to analyze the predictive capacity of our cost model and the benefits of
the query optimization technique. Our study has been conducted over synthetic
and real-world OWL ontologies, and shows that the techniques are accurate and
improve query performance. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic

describing the order of first occurrence of the respective symbol in the
original sequence. In a recent paper, tight general bounds on the block entropy
of patterns of sequences generated by independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) sources were derived. In this paper, precise approximations are
provided for the pattern block entropies for patterns of sequences generated by
i.i.d. uniform and monotonic distributions, including distributions over the
integers, and the geometric distribution. Numerical bounds on the pattern block
entropies of these distributions are provided even for very short blocks. Tight
bounds are obtained even for distributions that have infinite i.i.d. entropy
rates. The approximations are obtained using general bounds and their
derivation techniques. Conditional index entropy is also studied for
distributions over smaller alphabets.

information available to an observer at any point in space and time. Samples of
the plenoptic function (POF) are seen in video and in general visual content,
and represent large amounts of information. In this paper we propose a
stochastic model to study the compression limits of the plenoptic function. In
the proposed framework, we isolate the two fundamental sources of information
in the POF: the one representing the camera motion and the other representing
the information complexity of the &quot;reality&quot; being acquired and transmitted. The
sources of information are combined, generating a stochastic process that we
study in detail. We first propose a model for ensembles of realities that do
not change over time. The proposed model is simple in that it enables us to
derive precise coding bounds in the information-theoretic sense that are sharp
in a number of cases of practical interest. For this simple case of static
realities and camera motion, our results indicate that coding practice is in
accordance with optimal coding from an information-theoretic standpoint. The
model is further extended to account for visual realities that change over
time. We derive bounds on the lossless and lossy information rates for this
dynamic reality model, stating conditions under which the bounds are tight.
Examples with synthetic sources suggest that in the presence of scene dynamics,
simple hybrid coding using motion/displacement estimation with DPCM performs
considerably suboptimally relative to the true rate-distortion bound.

parts is to present the machinery behind bi-capacities, and thus remains on a
rather theoretical level, although some parts are firmly rooted in decision

the introduction of bi-capacities and the structure on which they are defined.
We define the M\&quot;obius transform of bi-capacities, by just applying the well
known theory of M\&quot; obius functions as established by Rota to the particular
case of bi-capacities. Then, we introduce derivatives of bi-capacities, by
analogy with what was done for pseudo-Boolean functions (another view of
capacities and set functions), and this is the key point to introduce the
Shapley value and the interaction index for bi-capacities. This is done in a
cooperative game theoretic perspective. In summary, all familiar notions used
for fuzzy measures are available in this more general framework.

can be applied to many fields in decision making and data analysis. It
generalizes the notion of interaction defined for criteria modelled by
capacities, by considering functions defined on lattices. For a given problem,
the lattice contains for each attribute the partially ordered set of remarkable
points or levels. The interaction is based on the notion of derivative of a
function defined on a lattice, and appears as a generalization of the Shapley
value or other probabilistic values.

customer suppose to be able to manage the manufacturing process chosen to
realise the parts. A simulation step is generally performed to verify that the
expected generated deviations fit with these requirements. It is then necessary
to assess the actual deviations of the process in progress. This is usually
done by the verification of the conformity of the workpiece to manufacturing
tolerances at the end of each set-up. It is thus necessary to determine these
manufacturing tolerances. This step is called &quot;manufacturing tolerance
synthesis&quot;. In this paper, a numerical method is proposed to perform 3D
manufacturing tolerances synthesis. This method uses the result of the
numerical analysis of tolerances to determine influent mall displacement of
surfaces. These displacements are described by small displacements torsors. An
algorithm is then proposed to determine suitable ISO manufacturing tolerances.

Logics and rules on the Semantic Web.We define guarded hybrid knowledge bases
(or g-hybrid knowledge bases) as knowledge bases that consist of a Description
Logic knowledge base and a guarded logic program, similar to the DL+log
knowledge bases from (Rosati 2006). G-hybrid knowledge bases enable an
integration of Description Logics and Logic Programming where, unlike in other
approaches, variables in the rules of a guarded program do not need to appear
in positive non-DL atoms of the body, i.e. DL atoms can act as guards as well.
Decidability of satisfiability checking of g-hybrid knowledge bases is shown
for the particular DL DLRO, which is close to OWL DL, by a reduction to guarded
programs under the open answer set semantics. Moreover, we show
2-EXPTIME-completeness for satisfiability checking of such g-hybrid knowledge
bases. Finally, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of our approach
compared with DL+log knowledge bases.

multi-criteria traveling salesman problem (TSP).
  First, we devise randomized approximation algorithms for multi-criteria
maximum traveling salesman problems (Max-TSP). For multi-criteria Max-STSP,
where the edge weights have to be symmetric, we devise an algorithm with an
approximation ratio of 2/3 - eps. For multi-criteria Max-ATSP, where the edge
weights may be asymmetric, we present an algorithm with a ratio of 1/2 - eps.
Our algorithms work for any fixed number k of objectives. Furthermore, we
present a deterministic algorithm for bi-criteria Max-STSP that achieves an
approximation ratio of 7/27.
  Finally, we present a randomized approximation algorithm for the asymmetric
multi-criteria minimum TSP with triangle inequality Min-ATSP. This algorithm
achieves a ratio of log n + eps.

Invasive Surgery, to make the post-operative constraints less painful for the
patient. Actually, new surgical tools or medical products are designed after
informal discussions between surgeons and designers. The user requirements
documents are the main document used by the mechanical designers to design and
improve the product. Medical terms, often used by surgeons and employed to
explain their needs, don't allow for an instantaneous understanding by
designers. Unfortunately, this relation causes a dysfunction in the definition
cycle of the product. Our aim is to work on the design process, its assistance
thanks to methods and tools and on its organisation for better understandings
and more complementarities between surgeons and designers. We propose on this
article a design method already tested in the informatics domain: User Centred
Design which takes the user into account more effectively in the process
design. We already propose a scenario oriented design method centred on the
user and represented as a scenario (Scenario-Based Design). We start in this
article by clarifying these concepts before detailing their implementation for
the design of a new surgical tool.

  approximation ratio</title><categories>cs.DS</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The Metric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical NP-hard
optimization problem. The double-tree shortcutting method for Metric TSP yields
an exponentially-sized space of TSP tours, each of which approximates the
optimal solution within at most a factor of 2. We consider the problem of
finding among these tours the one that gives the closest approximation, i.e.\
the \emph{minimum-weight double-tree shortcutting}. Previously, we gave an
efficient algorithm for this problem, and carried out its experimental
analysis. In this paper, we address the related question of the worst-case
approximation ratio for the minimum-weight double-tree shortcutting method. In
particular, we give lower bounds on the approximation ratio in some specific
metric spaces: the ratio of 2 in the discrete shortest path metric, 1.622 in
the planar Euclidean metric, and 1.666 in the planar Minkowski metric. The
first of these lower bounds is tight; we conjecture that the other two bounds
are also tight, and in particular that the minimum-weight double-tree method
provides a 1.622-approximation for planar Euclidean TSP.

edge distribution of its associated graph is investigated. First, it is shown
that adding one edge to a cycle definitely decreases the network
sychronizability. Then, since sometimes the synchronizability can be enhanced
by changing the network structure, the question of whether the networks with
more edges are easier to synchronize is addressed. It is shown by examples that
the answer is negative. This reveals that generally there are redundant edges
in a network, which not only make no contributions to synchronization but
actually may reduce the synchronizability. Moreover, an example shows that the
node betweenness centrality is not always a good indicator for the network
synchronizability. Finally, some more examples are presented to illustrate how
the network synchronizability varies following the addition of edges, where all
the examples show that the network synchronizability globally increases but
locally fluctuates as the number of added edges increases.

can change schemata only with its neighbors according to a rule. The rule
methodology and the neighborhood structure employ elements from the Cellular
Automata (CA) strategies. Each member of the GA population is assigned to a
cell and crossover takes place only between adjacent cells, according to the
predefined rule. Although combinations of CA and GA approaches have appeared
previously, here we rely on the inherent self-organizing features of CA, rather
than on parallelism. This conceptual shift directs us toward the evolution of
compact populations containing only a handful of members. We find that the
resulting algorithm can search the design space more efficiently than
traditional GA strategies due to its ability to exploit mutations within this
compact self-organizing population. Consequently, premature convergence is
avoided and the final results often are more accurate. In order to reinforce
the superior mutation capability, a re-initialization strategy also is
implemented. Ten test functions and two benchmark structural engineering truss
design problems are examined in order to demonstrate the performance of the
method.

annotation for supporting design communication. In this paper, we describe a
co-operative design case study where we analyse some annotation practices,
mainly focused on design minutes recorded during project reviews. We point out
specific requirements concerning annotation needs. Based on these requirements,
we propose an annotation model, inspired from the Speech Act Theory (SAT) to
support communication in a 3D digital environment. We define two types of
annotations in the engineering design context, locutionary and illocutionary
annotations. The annotations we describe in this paper are materialised by a
set of digital artefacts, which have a semantic dimension allowing
express/record elements of technical justifications, traces of contradictory
debates, etc. In this paper, we first clarify the semantic annotation concept,
and we define general properties of annotations in the engineering design
context, and the role of annotations in different design project situations.
After the description of the case study, where we observe and analyse
annotations usage during the design reviews and minute making, the last section
is dedicated to present our approach. We then describe the SAT concept, and
define the concept of annotation acts. We conclude with a description of basic
annotation functionalities that are actually implemented in a software, based
on our approach.

relations modelled through Choquet integral with respect to a $k$-additive
capacity, i.e. whose M\&quot;obius transform vanishes for subsets of more than $k$
elements. Thus, $k$-additive capacities range from probability measures ($k=1$)
to general capacities ($k=n$). The axiomatization is done in several steps,
starting from symmetric 2-additive capacities, a case related to the Gini
index, and finishing with general $k$-additive capacities. We put an emphasis
on 2-additive capacities. Our axiomatization is done in the framework of social
welfare, and complete previous results of Weymark, Gilboa and Ben Porath, and
Gajdos.

endow it with two operations extending supremum and infimum, so as to obtain an
algebraic structure close to a commutative ring. We show that imposing symmetry
necessarily entails non associativity, hence computing rules are defined in
order to deal with non associativity. We study in details computing rules,
which we endow with a partial order. This permits to find solutions to the
inversion formula underlying the M\&quot;obius transform. Then we apply these
results to the case of capacities, a notion from decision theory which
corresponds, in the language of ordered sets, to order preserving mappings,
preserving also top and bottom. In this case, the solution of the inversion
formula is called the M\&quot;obius transform of the capacity. Properties and
examples of M\&quot;obius transform of sup-preserving and inf-preserving capacities
are given.

  Distance Enumerators</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>24 pages; submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</comments><abstract>  The analysis of random coding error exponents pertaining to erasure/list
decoding, due to Forney, is revisited. Instead of using Jensen's inequality as
well as some other inequalities in the derivation, we demonstrate that an
exponentially tight analysis can be carried out by assessing the relevant
moments of a certain distance enumerator. The resulting bound has the following
advantages: (i) it is at least as tight as Forney's bound, (ii) under certain
symmetry conditions associated with the channel and the random coding
distribution, it is simpler than Forney's bound in the sense that it involves
an optimization over one parameter only (rather than two), and (iii) in certain
special cases, like the binary symmetric channel (BSC), the optimum value of
this parameter can be found in closed form, and so, there is no need to conduct
a numerical search. We have not found yet, however, a numerical example where
this new bound is strictly better than Forney's bound. This may provide an
additional evidence to support Forney's conjecture that his bound is tight for
the average code. We believe that the technique we suggest in this paper can be
useful in simplifying, and hopefully also improving, exponential error bounds
in other problem settings as well.

the disjunction, numerical existence and term existence properties. An inner

computing a host of fundamental graph invariants such as the chromatic, flow,
and reliability polynomials in graph theory, the Jones polynomial of an
alternating link in knot theory, and the partition functions of the models of
Ising, Potts, and Fortuin--Kasteleyn in statistical physics. Prior to this
work, deletion--contraction was also the fastest known general-purpose
algorithm for these invariants, running in time roughly proportional to the
number of spanning trees in the input graph. Here, we give a substantially
faster algorithm that computes the Tutte polynomial--and hence, all the
aforementioned invariants and more--of an arbitrary graph in time within a
polynomial factor of the number of connected vertex sets. The algorithm
actually evaluates a multivariate generalization of the Tutte polynomial by
making use of an identity due to Fortuin and Kasteleyn. We also provide a
polynomial-space variant of the algorithm and give an analogous result for
Chung and Graham's cover polynomial. An implementation of the algorithm
outperforms deletion--contraction also in practice.

correlations of data stored in the corresponding database entries. The original
method (F. Bagnoli, A. Berrones and F. Franci. Physica A 332 (2004) 509-518)
was formulated in the context of opinion formation. The opinions expressed over
a set of topic originate a ``knowledge network'' among individuals, where two
individuals are nearer the more similar their expressed opinions are. Assuming
that individuals' opinions are stored in a database, the authors show that it
is possible to anticipate an opinion using the correlations in the database.
This corresponds to approximating the overlap between the tastes of two
individuals with the correlations of their expressed opinions.
  In this paper we extend this model to nonlinear matching functions, inspired
by biological problems such as microarray (probe-sample pairing). We
investigate numerically the error between the correlation and the overlap
matrix for eight sequences of reference with random probes. Results show that
this method is particularly robust for detecting similarities in the presence
of translocations.

appropriate for both Intranet and Internet applications. In our approach the
players dynamically form a network in which they know neither their neighbours
nor the size of the network and interact to jointly take decisions. The only
assumption concerning the underlying communication layer is that for each pair
of processes there is a path of neighbours connecting them. This allows us to
deal with arbitrary network topologies.
  We also discuss the implementation of this system which consists of a
sequence of layers. The lower layers deal with the operations that implement
the basic primitives of distributed computing, namely low level communication
and distributed termination, while the upper layers use these primitives to
implement high level communication among players, including broadcasting and
multicasting, and distributed decision making.
  This yields a highly flexible distributed system whose specific applications
are realized as instances of its top layer. This design is implemented in Java.
  The system supports at various levels fault-tolerance and includes a
provision for distributed policing the purpose of which is to exclude
`dishonest' players. Also, it can be used for repeated creation of dynamically
formed networks of players interested in a joint decision making implemented by
means of a tax-based mechanism. We illustrate its flexibility by discussing a
number of implemented examples.

  submission: Nov. 2007)</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We consider a MIMO fading broadcast channel and compute achievable ergodic
rates when channel state information is acquired at the receivers via downlink
training and it is provided to the transmitter by channel state feedback.
Unquantized (analog) and quantized (digital) channel state feedback schemes are
analyzed and compared under various assumptions. Digital feedback is shown to
be potentially superior when the feedback channel uses per channel state
coefficient is larger than 1. Also, we show that by proper design of the
digital feedback link, errors in the feedback have a minor effect even if
simple uncoded modulation is used on the feedback channel. We discuss first the
case of an unfaded AWGN feedback channel with orthogonal access and then the
case of fading MIMO multi-access (MIMO-MAC). We show that by exploiting the
MIMO-MAC nature of the uplink channel, a much better scaling of the feedback
channel resource with the number of base station antennas can be achieved.
Finally, for the case of delayed feedback, we show that in the realistic case
where the fading process has (normalized) maximum Doppler frequency shift 0 &lt; F
&lt; 1/2, a fraction 1 - 2F of the optimal multiplexing gain is achievable. The
general conclusion of this work is that very significant downlink throughput is
achievable with simple and efficient channel state feedback, provided that the
feedback link is properly designed.

$(X_n)_{n\geq 1}$ with distribution $P$ is to be compressed with distortion no
greater than $D\geq 0$, using a memoryless random codebook with distribution
$Q$. The compression performance is determined by the ``generalized asymptotic
equipartition property'' (AEP), which states that the probability of finding a
$D$-close match between $X_1^n$ and any given codeword $Y_1^n$, is
approximately $2^{-n R(P,Q,D)}$, where the rate function $R(P,Q,D)$ can be
expressed as an infimum of relative entropies. The main purpose here is to
remove various restrictive assumptions on the validity of this result that have
appeared in the recent literature. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the
generalized AEP are provided in the general setting of abstract alphabets and
unbounded distortion measures. All possible distortion levels $D\geq 0$ are
considered; the source $(X_n)_{n\geq 1}$ can be stationary and ergodic; and the
codebook distribution can have memory. Moreover, the behavior of the matching
probability is precisely characterized, even when the generalized AEP is not
valid. Natural characterizations of the rate function $R(P,Q,D)$ are
established under equally general conditions.

a major enhancement to the standard is the addition of decimal format.
Furthermore, in the recent years reversible logic has emerged as a promising
computing paradigm having its applications in low power CMOS, quantum
computing, nanotechnology, and optical computing. The major goal in reversible
logic is to minimize the number of reversible gates and garbage outputs. Thus,
this paper proposes the novel concept of partial reversible gates that will
satisfy the reversibility criteria for specific cases in BCD arithmetic. The
partial reversible gate is proposed to minimize the number of reversible gates
and garbage outputs, while designing the reversible BCD arithmetic circuits.

which each relay decodes a selection of transmitted messages by other
transmitting terminals, and forwards parities of the decoded codewords. This
protocol improves the previously known achievable rate of the
decode-and-forward (DF) strategy for multirelay networks by allowing relays to
decode only a selection of messages from relays with strong links to it. Hence,
each relay may have several choices as to which messages to decode, and for a
given network many different parity forwarding protocols may exist. A tree
structure is devised to characterize a class of parity forwarding protocols for
an arbitrary multirelay network. Based on this tree structure, closed-form
expressions for the achievable rates of these DF schemes are derived. It is
shown that parity forwarding is capacity achieving for new forms of degraded
relay networks.

characterization of throughput scaling for random extended wireless networks
(i.e., $n$ nodes are placed uniformly at random in a square region of area
$n$). They showed that for small path-loss exponents $\alpha\in(2,3]$
cooperative communication is order optimal, and for large path-loss exponents
$\alpha &gt; 3$ multi-hop communication is order optimal. However, their results
(both the communication scheme and the proof technique) are strongly dependent
on the regularity induced with high probability by the random node placement.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of characterizing the throughput
scaling in extended wireless networks with arbitrary node placement. As a main
result, we propose a more general novel cooperative communication scheme that
works for arbitrarily placed nodes. For small path-loss exponents $\alpha \in
(2,3]$, we show that our scheme is order optimal for all node placements, and
achieves exactly the same throughput scaling as in Ozgur et al. This shows that
the regularity of the node placement does not affect the scaling of the
achievable rates for $\alpha\in (2,3]$. The situation is, however, markedly
different for large path-loss exponents $\alpha &gt;3$. We show that in this
regime the scaling of the achievable per-node rates depends crucially on the
regularity of the node placement. We then present a family of schemes that
smoothly &quot;interpolate&quot; between multi-hop and cooperative communication,
depending upon the level of regularity in the node placement. We establish
order optimality of these schemes under adversarial node placement for $\alpha
&gt; 3$.

  Although the areas of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), CSCW, and CSCL are
now relatively well established, the related field of Computer Supported
Collaborative Research (CSCR) is new and little understood. An analysis of the
principles and issues behind CSCR is undertaken with a view to determining
precisely its nature and scope and to delineate it clearly from CSCW and CSCL.
This determination is such that it is generally applicable to the building,
design and evaluation of collaborative research environments.
  A particular instance of the CSCR domain is then examined in order to
determine the requirements of a collaborative research environment for students
and supervisors (CRESS).

  Channels</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to Transactions on Information Theory</comments><abstract>  Information embedding (IE) is the transmission of information within a host
signal subject to a distortion constraint. There are two types of embedding
methods, namely irreversible IE and reversible IE, depending upon whether or
not the host, as well as the message, is recovered at the decoder. In
irreversible IE, only the embedded message is recovered at the decoder, and in
reversible IE, both the message and the host are recovered at the decoder. This
paper considers combinations of irreversible and reversible IE in multiple
access channels (MAC) and physically degraded broadcast channels (BC).

  means of Epidemic Spreading Models</title><categories>cs.NI</categories><abstract>  Epidemics-inspired techniques have received huge attention in recent years
from the distributed systems and networking communities. These algorithms and
protocols rely on probabilistic message replication and redundancy to ensure
reliable communication. Moreover, they have been successfully exploited to
support group communication in distributed systems, broadcasting, multicasting
and information dissemination in fixed and mobile networks. However, in most of
the existing work, the probability of infection is determined heuristically,
without relying on any analytical model. This often leads to unnecessarily high
transmission overheads.
  In this paper we show that models of epidemic spreading in complex networks
can be applied to the problem of tuning and controlling the dissemination of
information in wireless ad hoc networks composed of devices carried by
individuals, i.e., human-based networks. The novelty of our idea resides in the
evaluation and exploitation of the structure of the underlying human network
for the automatic tuning of the dissemination process in order to improve the
protocol performance. We evaluate the results using synthetic mobility models
and real human contacts traces.

of random variables bounded in between zero and one. We have rigorously
demonstrated that, in order to guarantee prescribed relative precision and
confidence level, it suffices to continue sampling until the sample sum is no
less than a certain bound and then take the average of samples as an estimate
for the mean of the bounded random variable. We have developed an explicit
formula and a bisection search method for the determination of such bound of
sample sum, without any knowledge of the bounded variable. Moreover, we have
derived bounds for the distribution of sample size. In the special case of
Bernoulli random variables, we have established analytical and numerical
methods to further reduce the bound of sample sum and thus improve the
efficiency of sampling. Furthermore, the fallacy of existing results are
detected and analyzed.

architecture is an essential stake nowadays. In professional practices the
actors involved in construction projects use numerous tools. The project is
unique but the &quot;views&quot; that actors manipulate are various and sometimes
fundamentally different. Their common characteristic is that they partially
represent the cooperation context through a specific point of view.
&quot;Bat'iViews&quot; suggests to the actors a multi-view interface of the context and
enables to navigate through the different views. This proposition is based on a
model-driven approach. We distinguish between &quot;context modelling&quot; and modelling
of concepts represented in each &quot;businessview&quot;. A model integrative
infrastructure allows us to develop the prototype and to manage user
interaction through the definition of models' transformations.

i.e. networks of $M$ transmitters and $N$ receivers where every transmitter has
an independent message for every receiver. We derive a general outerbound on
the degrees of freedom \emph{region} of these networks. When all nodes have a
single antenna and all channel coefficients vary in time or frequency, we show
that the \emph{total} number of degrees of freedom of the $X$ network is equal
to $\frac{MN}{M+N-1}$ per orthogonal time and frequency dimension.
Achievability is proved by constructing interference alignment schemes for $X$
networks that can come arbitrarily close to the outerbound on degrees of
freedom. For the case where either M=2 or N=2 we find that the outerbound is
exactly achievable. While $X$ networks have significant degrees of freedom
benefits over interference networks when the number of users is small, our
results show that as the number of users increases, this advantage disappears.
Thus, for large $K$, the $K\times K$ user wireless $X$ network loses half the
degrees of freedom relative to the $K\times K$ MIMO outerbound achievable
through full cooperation. Interestingly, when there are few transmitters
sending to many receivers ($N\gg M$) or many transmitters sending to few
receivers ($M\gg N$), $X$ networks are able to approach the $\min(M,N)$ degrees
of freedom possible with full cooperation on the $M\times N$ MIMO channel.
Similar to the interference channel, we also construct an example of a 2 user
$X$ channel with propagation delays where the outerbound on degrees of freedom
is achieved through interference alignment based on a simple TDMA strategy.

Our recent efforts are exerted on improving the local public access to global
scientific data, and on the other hand encouraging the local scientific data to
be more accessible for the global communities. We have maintained
well-connected infrastructure and some web-based information management systems
to realize such objectives. This paper is especially focused on introducing the
ARSIP for mirroring global as well as sharing local scientific data, and the
newly developed Indonesian Scientific Index for integrating local scientific
data through an automated intelligent indexing system.

proper $k$-coloring of the vertices of $G$ such that every vertex $v$ of degree
$d(v)$ in $G$ is adjacent to vertices with at least $min\{r, d(v)\}$ different
colors. The smallest integer $k$ for which a graph $G$ has a conditional
$(k,r)$-coloring is called the $r$th order conditional chromatic number,
denoted by $\chi_r(G)$. It is easy to see that the conditional coloring is a
generalization of the traditional vertex coloring for which $r=1$. In this
paper, we consider the complexity of the conditional colorings of graphs. The
main result is that the conditional $(3,2)$-colorability is $NP$-complete for
triangle-free graphs with maximum degree at most 3, which is different from the
old result that the traditional 3-colorability is polynomial solvable for
graphs with maximum degree at most 3. This also implies that it is
$NP$-complete to determine if a graph of maximum degree 3 is $(3,2)$- or
$(4,2)$-colorable. Also we have proved that some old complexity results for
traditional colorings still hold for the conditional colorings.

be calculated in the trellis or a sub-trellis. The forward/backward recursion
known from the BCJR algorithm is generalized to compute the moments of these
distributions. In analogy to the symbol probabilities, by introducing a
constraint at a certain depth in the trellis we obtain symbol moments. These
moments are required for an efficient implementation of the discriminated
belief propagation algorithm in [2], and can furthermore be utilized to compute
conditional entropies in the trellis.
  The moment computation algorithm has the same asymptotic complexity as the
BCJR algorithm. It is applicable to any commutative semi-ring, thus actually
providing a generalization of the Viterbi algorithm.

assumption that quantum storage of qubits is noisy. We thereby consider
individual-storage attacks, i.e. the dishonest party attempts to store each
incoming qubit separately. Our model is similar to the model of bounded-quantum
storage, however, we consider an explicit noise model inspired by present-day
technology. To illustrate the power of this new model, we show that a protocol
for oblivious transfer (OT) is secure for any amount of quantum-storage noise,
as long as honest players can perform perfect quantum operations. Our model
also allows the security of protocols that cope with noise in the operations of
the honest players and achieve more advanced tasks such as secure
identification.

  Intelligence</comments><acm-class>I.2.11; D.3.3</acm-class><abstract>  The notion of optimality naturally arises in many areas of applied
mathematics and computer science concerned with decision making. Here we
consider this notion in the context of three formalisms used for different
purposes in reasoning about multi-agent systems: strategic games, CP-nets, and
soft constraints. To relate the notions of optimality in these formalisms we
introduce a natural qualitative modification of the notion of a strategic game.
We show then that the optimal outcomes of a CP-net are exactly the Nash
equilibria of such games. This allows us to use the techniques of game theory
to search for optimal outcomes of CP-nets and vice-versa, to use techniques
developed for CP-nets to search for Nash equilibria of the considered games.
Then, we relate the notion of optimality used in the area of soft constraints
to that used in a generalization of strategic games, called graphical games. In
particular we prove that for a natural class of soft constraints that includes
weighted constraints every optimal solution is both a Nash equilibrium and
Pareto efficient joint strategy. For a natural mapping in the other direction
we show that Pareto efficient joint strategies coincide with the optimal
solutions of soft constraints.

technique to the land cover mapping community. They have their roots in
Statistical Learning Theory and have gained prominence because they are robust,
accurate and are effective even when using a small training sample. By their
nature SVMs are essentially binary classifiers, however, they can be adopted to
handle the multiple classification tasks common in remote sensing studies. The
two approaches commonly used are the One-Against-One (1A1) and One-Against-All
(1AA) techniques. In this paper, these approaches are evaluated in as far as
their impact and implication for land cover mapping. The main finding from this
research is that whereas the 1AA technique is more predisposed to yielding
unclassified and mixed pixels, the resulting classification accuracy is not
significantly different from 1A1 approach. It is the authors conclusion
therefore that ultimately the choice of technique adopted boils down to
personal preference and the uniqueness of the dataset at hand.

&quot;most desirable&quot; elements given a binary dominance relation on a set of
alternatives. Schwartz's tournament equilibrium set (TEQ) ranks among the most
intriguing, but also among the most enigmatic, tournament solutions that have
been proposed so far in this context. Due to its unwieldy recursive definition,
little is known about TEQ. In particular, its monotonicity remains an open
problem up to date. Yet, if TEQ were to satisfy monotonicity, it would be a
very attractive tournament solution concept refining both the Banks set and
Dutta's minimal covering set. We show that the problem of deciding whether a
given alternative is contained in TEQ is NP-hard.

between actors is essential for project success. The configuration of actors'
organization takes different forms like the associated coordination mechanisms.
Our approach consists in analyzing these coordination mechanisms through the
identification of the &quot;base practices&quot; realized by the actors of a construction
project to cooperate. We also try with practitioners to highlight the &quot;best

aiming to demonstrate the value added of IT to support cooperation. These
prototype tools allow us to sensitize the actors through terrain experiments
and then to bring inch by inch the Luxembourgish AEC sector towards electronic
cooperation.

that every subset of 1,...,n can be written as a disjoint union of at most k
members of G, where k and n are given numbers. This problem originates in a
real-world application aiming at the diversity of industrial production. At the
same time, the minimum of G so that every subset of 1,...,n is the union of two
sets in G has been asked by Erdos and studied recently by Furedi and Katona
without requiring the disjointness of the sets. A simple construction providing
a feasible solution is conjectured to be optimal for this problem for all
values of n and k and regardless of the disjointness requirement; we prove this
conjecture in special cases including all (n,k) for which n &lt;= 3k holds, and
some individual values of n and k.

decoding of convolutional codes. ML decoding can be modeled as finding the most
probable path taken through a Markov graph. Integrated with the Viterbi
algorithm (VA), complexity reduction methods such as the sphere decoder often
use the sum log likelihood (SLL) of a Markov path as a bound to disprove the
optimality of other Markov path sets and to consequently avoid exhaustive path
search. In this paper, it is shown that SLL-based optimality tests are
inefficient if one fixes the coding memory and takes the codeword length to
infinity. Alternatively, optimality of a source symbol at a given time index
can be testified using bounds derived from log likelihoods of the neighboring
symbols. It is demonstrated that such neighboring log likelihood (NLL)-based
optimality tests, whose efficiency does not depend on the codeword length, can
bring significant complexity reduction to ML decoding of convolutional codes.
The results are generalized to ML sequence detection in a class of
discrete-time hidden Markov systems.

signal incurs interference from a finite number of users (interfering users)
that use single codebooks for transmitting their own messages. The receiver,
however, is allowed to decode interfering users' messages. This means the
signal transmitted from any interfering user is either decoded or considered as
noise at the receiver side. We propose the following method to obtain an
achievable rate for this channel. Assuming its own data is decoded
successfully, the receiver partitions the set of interfering users into two
disjoint subsets, namely the set of decodable users and the set of
non-decodable users. Then the transmitter's rate is chosen such that the
intended signal can be jointly decoded with the set of decodable users. To show
the strength of this method, we prove that for the additive Gaussian channel
with Gaussian interfering users, the Gaussian distribution is optimal and the
achievable rate is the capacity of this channel. To obtain the maximum
achievable rate, one needs to find the maximum decodable subset of interfering
users. Due to the large number of possible choices, having efficient algorithms
that find the set of decodable users with maximum cardinality is desired. To
this end, we propose an algorithm that enables the receiver to accomplish this
task in polynomial time.

  Decode-and-Forward Transmission</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>27 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Vehicular
  Technology, revised May 2008</comments><abstract>  This paper considers the problem of selecting a subset of nodes in a two-hop
wireless network to act as relays in aiding the communication between the
source-destination pair. Optimal relay subset selection with the objective of
maximizing the overall throughput is a difficult problem that depends on
multiple factors including node locations, queue lengths and power consumption.
A partial decode-and-forward strategy is applied in this paper to improve the
tractability of the relay selection problem and performance of the overall
network.
  Note that the number of relays selected ultimately determines the performance
of the network. This paper benchmarks this performance by determining the net
diversity achieved using the relays selected and the partial decode-and-forward
strategy. This framework is subsequently used to further transform relay
selection into a simpler relay placement problem, and two proximity-based
approximation algorithms are developed to determine the appropriate set of
relays to be selected in the network. Other selection strategies such as random
relay selection and a greedy algorithm that relies on channel state information
are also presented. This paper concludes by showing that the proposed
proximity-based relay selection strategies yield near-optimal expected rates
for a small number of selected relays.

by a set $\P$ of probability distributions and the agent observes that a random
variable $X$ takes on value $x$, given that the agent makes decisions using the
minimax criterion, perhaps the best-studied and most commonly-used criterion in
the literature. We adopt a game-theoretic framework, where the agent plays
against a bookie, who chooses some distribution from $\P$. We consider two
reasonable games that differ in what the bookie knows when he makes his choice.
Anomalies that have been observed before, like time inconsistency, can be
understood as arising important because different games are being played,
against bookies with different information. We characterize the important
special cases in which the optimal decision rules according to the minimax
criterion amount to either conditioning or simply ignoring the information.
Finally, we consider the relationship between conditioning and calibration when
uncertainty is described by sets of probabilities.

broad class of information-theoretic distortion measures called Bregman
divergences. Bregman divergences are versatile, and unify quadratic geometric
distances with various statistical entropic measures. Because Bregman
divergences are typically asymmetric, we consider both the left-sided and
right-sided centroids and the symmetrized centroids, and prove that all three
are unique. We give closed-form solutions for the sided centroids that are
generalized means, and design a provably fast and efficient approximation
algorithm for the symmetrized centroid based on its exact geometric
characterization that requires solely to walk on the geodesic linking the two
sided centroids. We report on our generic implementation for computing entropic
centers of image clusters and entropic centers of multivariate normals, and
compare our results with former ad-hoc methods.

clusters and propose a distributed dynamic frequency allocation algorithm that
achieves performance close to that of a centralized optimal algorithm. Each
cluster chooses its transmission frequency band based on its knowledge of the
interference that it experiences. The convergence of the proposed distributed
algorithm to a sub-optimal frequency allocation pattern is proved. For some
specific cases of spatial distributions of the clusters in the network,
asymptotic bounds on the performance of the algorithm are derived and
comparisons to the performance of optimal centralized solutions are made. These
analytic results and additional simulation studies verify performance close to
that of an optimum centralized frequency allocation algorithm. It is
demonstrated that the algorithm achieves about 90% of the Shannon capacities
corresponding to the optimum/near-optimum centralized frequency band
assignments. Furthermore, we consider the scenario where each cluster can be in
active or inactive mode according to a two-state Markov model. We derive
conditions to guarantee finite steady state variance for the output of the
algorithm using stochastic analysis. Further simulation studies confirm the
results of stochastic modeling and the performance of the algorithm in the
time-varying setup.

in directed graphs. The proposed deterministic dynamic algorithm has an update
time of $O((ins*n^{2}) + (del * (m+n*log(n))))$ where $m$ is the current number
of edges, $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph, $ins$ is the number of
edge insertions and $del$ is the number of edge deletions. Each query can be
answered in O(1) time after each update. The proposed algorithm combines
existing fully dynamic reachability algorithm with well known witness counting
technique to improve efficiency of maintaining reachability information when
edges are deleted. The proposed algorithm improves by a factor of
$O(\frac{n^2}{m+n*log(n)})$ for edge deletion over the best existing fully
dynamic algorithm for maintaining reachability information.

  Channel</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>20 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE JSAC November 2007</comments><abstract>  Block diagonalization is a linear precoding technique for the multiple
antenna broadcast (downlink) channel that involves transmission of multiple
data streams to each receiver such that no multi-user interference is
experienced at any of the receivers. This low-complexity scheme operates only a
few dB away from capacity but requires very accurate channel knowledge at the
transmitter. We consider a limited feedback system where each receiver knows
its channel perfectly, but the transmitter is only provided with a finite
number of channel feedback bits from each receiver. Using a random quantization
argument, we quantify the throughput loss due to imperfect channel knowledge as
a function of the feedback level. The quality of channel knowledge must improve
proportional to the SNR in order to prevent interference-limitations, and we
show that scaling the number of feedback bits linearly with the system SNR is
sufficient to maintain a bounded rate loss. Finally, we compare our
quantization strategy to an analog feedback scheme and show the superiority of
quantized feedback.

entails the maturation of the design and all the processes needed to
successfully produce a product. Elements such as tooling design, fixtures,

often overlooked as MEMS engineers concentrate on design, fabrication and

utilizes the UV proximity printing and photoresist replication methods. The
concave microlens array mold was made using a printing gap in lithography

the aperture edges and produces a certain exposure in the photoresist material
outside the aperture edges. This method can precisely control the geometric

concave micro-lens array in photoresist could be formed automatically when the
printing gap ranged from 240 micron to 720 micron. High fill factor microlens
array can be produced, when the control pitch distance between the adjacent
apertures of the concave microlens array was decreased to the aperture size.

deposition (PLD) on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates using a template layer derived by
sol-gel method. A 0.1-$\mu$m-thick PZT layer with (111) or (100)-preferred
orientation was first deposited onto Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates using the sol-gel
method, and than a PZT layer with thickness of 1$\mu$m was in situ deposited by
PLD on the above-mentioned PZT layer. The crystalline phases and the preferred
orientations of the PZT films were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis.
Surface and cross-sectional morphologies were observed by scanning electron
microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrical properties of
the films were evaluated by measuring their P-E hysteresis loops and dielectric
constants. The preferred orientation of the films can be controlled using the
template layer derived by the sol-gel method. The deposition temperature
required to obtain the perovskite phase in this process is approximately 460
degrees C, and is significantly lower than that in the case of direct film
deposition by PLD on the Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates.

new three-axial force sensor used in dimensional metrology of micro components.
The siliconbased sensor system consists of piezoresistive mechanicalstress
transducers integrated in thin membrane hinges supporting a suspended flexible
cross structure. The mechanical behavior of the fragile micromechanical
structure isanalyzed for both static and dynamic load cases. This work
demonstrates that the silicon microstructure withstands static forces of 1.16N
applied orthogonally to the front-side of the structure. A statistical Weibull
analysis of the measured data shows that these values are significantly reduced
if the normal force is applied to the back of the sensor. Improvements of the
sensor system design for future development cycles are derived from the
measurement results.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2006, Stresa, Lago Maggiore : Italie (2006)</journal-ref><abstract>  Due to scaling laws, in microfluidic, flows are laminar. Consequently, mixing
between two liquids is mainly obtained by natural diffusion which may take a
long time or equivalently requires centimetre length channels. To reduce time
and length for mixing, it is possible to generate chaotic-like flows either by
modifying the channel geometry or by creating an external perturbation of the
flow. In this paper, an active micromixer is presented consisting on thermal
actuation with heating resistors. In order to disturb the liquid flow, an
oscillating transverse flow is generated by heating the liquid. Depending on
the value of boiling point, either bubble expansion or volumetric dilation
controlled the transverse flow amplitude. A chaotic like mixing is then induced
under particular conditions depending on volume expansion, liquid velocity,
frequency of actuation... This solution presents the advantage to achieve
mixing in a very short time (1s) and along a short channel distance (channel
width). It can also be integrated in a more complex device due to actuator
integration with microfluidics.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2006, Stresa, Lago Maggiore : Italie (2006)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper is devoted to the analysis of resonant MEMS sensors based on
discrete relay feedback techniques. One drawback of such techniques is that
some synchronization usually occurs between the discrete part and the
continuous part of the system: this results in sensor responses that are very
similar to the curves known as devil's staircases, i.e. the frequency does not
vary smoothly with the sensor's input. The main contribution of this paper is a
theoretical calculation of the resolution of such systems. The resolutions of
two existing resonant MEMS architectures are then calculated and these results
are discussed.

hairpin-shaped design is applied to the fuel/air recirculation channel. The
micro combustor can sustain a stable combustion with an exit temperature as
high as 1600 K. We have also successfully developed a micro turbine device,
which is equipped with enhanced micro air-bearings and driven by compressed
air. A rotation speed of 15,000 rpm has been demonstrated during lab test. In
this paper, we will introduce our research results major in the development of
micro combustor and micro turbine test device.

successfully to realize Seebeck micro generators: photolithography and
deposition methods allow to elaborate thin thermoelectric structures at the
micro-scale level. Our goal is to scavenge energy by developing a miniature
power source for operating electronic components. First Bi and Sb micro-devices
on silicon glass substrate have been manufactured with an area of 1cm2
including more than one hundred junctions. Each step of process fabrication has
been optimized: photolithography, deposition process, anneals conditions and
metallic connections. Different device structures have been realized with
different micro-line dimensions. Each devices performance will be reviewed and
discussed in function of their design structure.

inorganic porous media as the proton-exchange membrane instead of a common
ionomer such as Nafion, the fuel cell achieved a maximum power density of 58 mW

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2006, Stresa, Lago Maggiore : Italie (2006)</journal-ref><abstract>  Our paper presents a non-destructive thermal transient measurement method
that is able to reveal differences even in the micron size range of MEMS
structures. Devices of the same design can have differences in their
sacrificial layers as consequence of the differences in their manufacturing
processes e.g. different etching times. We have made simulations examining how
the etching quality reflects in the thermal behaviour of devices. These
simulations predicted change in the thermal behaviour of MEMS structures having
differences in their sacrificial layers. The theory was tested with
measurements of similar MEMS devices prepared with different etching times. In
the measurements we used the T3Ster thermal transient tester equipment. The
results show that deviations in the devices, as consequence of the different
etching times, result in different temperature elevations and manifest also as
shift in time in the relevant temperature transient curves.

  (http://irevues.inist.fr/tima-editions)</comments><proxy>ccsd hal-00189310</proxy><journal-ref>Dans Symposium on Design, Test, Integration and Packaging of
  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2006, Stresa, Lago Maggiore : Italie (2006)</journal-ref><abstract>  The process of nickel electroforming is becoming increasingly important in
the manufacture of MST products, as it has the potential to replicate complex
geometries with extremely high fidelity. Electroforming of nickel uses
multi-component electrolyte formulations in order to maximise desirable product
properties. In addition to nickel sulphamate (the major electrolyte component),
formulation additives can also comprise nickel chloride (to increase nickel
anode dissolution), sulphamic acid (to control pH), boric acid (to act as a pH
buffer), hardening/levelling agents (to increase deposit hardness and lustre)
and wetting agents (to aid surface wetting and thus prevent gas bubbles and
void formation). This paper investigates the effects of some of these variables
on internal stress and stretch as a function of applied current density.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2006, Stresa, Lago Maggiore : Italie (2006)</journal-ref><abstract>  In this research, a novel contact resistance model for the flat panel display
(FPD) packaging based on the within layer parallel and between layers series
resistance concepts was proposed. The FJ2530 anisotropic conductive films (ACF)
by Sony Inc. containing the currently smallest 3micron conductive particles was
used to conduct the experiments to verify the accuracy of the proposed model.
Calculated resistance of the chip-on-glass (COG) packaging by the proposed
model is 0.163\Omega. It is found that the gold bump with 0.162\Omega
resistance play the major role of the overall resistance. Although the
predicted resistance by the proposed model is only one third of the
experimentally measured value, it has been three-fold improvement compared to
the existing models.

and the thickness of polycrystalline Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) films deposited
on silicon and SiO2 were measured, in excellent agreement with theory. The
dispersion curve of the propagating SAW is calculated with a Boundary Element
Method (BEM)-Model based on Green's functions. The propagating SAW is generated
with a nanosecond laser in a narrowband scheme projecting stripes from a mask
on the surface of the sample. For this purpose a glass mask and a liquid
crystal display (LCD) mask are used. The slope of the SAW is then measured
using a probe beam setup. From the wavelength of the mask and the frequency of
the measured SAW, the dispersion curve is determined point by point. Fitting
the BEM-Model to the measured nonlinear dispersion curve provides several
physical parameters simultaneously. In the present work this is demonstrated
for the Young's modulus, the density and the thickness of SiGe films. The
results from the narrowband scheme measurement are in excellent agreement with
separated measurements of the thickness (profilometer), the density (balance)
and the Young's modulus (nanoindenter).

During bonding, continuous AuIn2, Ni3(Sn,In)4 and Cu6(Sn,In)5 intermetallic

solder/OSP interface, respectively. The interfacial reactions between the
solder and I-Ag substrate during bonding resulted in the formation of
Cu6(Sn,In)5 and Cu(Sn,In)2 IMCs with a minor Ag element. The In-48Sn/I-Ag
solder joint showed the best shear properties among the four solder joints
after bonding, whereas the solder/ENIG solder joint exhibited the weakest
mechanical integrity.

experimentally verified. A device with 200um gap gives a two-third offset down
compared with that of its counterpart with 50um gap.

micromachining module for MEMS hermetic packaging at temperatures around 180
degrees C based on nickel plating and photoresist sacrificial layers. The
advantages of thin film caps are the reduced thickness and area consumption and
the promise of being a low-cost batch process. Moreover, sealing happens by a
reflow technique, giving the freedom of choosing the pressure and atmosphere
inside the cavity. Sacrificial etch holes are situated above the device
allowing shorter release times compared to the state-of-the-art. With the
so-called over-plating process, small etch holes can be created in the membrane
without the need of expensive lithography tools. The etch holes in the membrane
have been shown to be sufficiently small to block the sealing material to pass
through, but still large enough to enable an efficient release.

has relatively outstanding performance. A silicon-based eight-order microstrip
bandpass filter is fabricated and measured. A novel design method of the
interdigital filter that can create two transmission zeros is described. The
location of the transmission zeros can be shifted arbitrarily in the stopband.
By adjusting the zero location properly, the filter provides much better skirt
rejection and lower insertion loss than a conventional microstrip interdigital
filter. To reduce the chip size, through-silicon-substrate-via-hole is used.
Good experimental results are obtained.

the major problems in the working time was that it spent most of time for
cooling and heating. In order to improve the efficient, this study presented a
novel method for amplify DNA sample. For this concept, the DNA sample in the
silicon chamber which was pushed by a beam through three temperature regions
around a center and then the DNA segments could be amplified rapidly after 30
cycles. The polymerase chain reaction platform was composed of thin-film
heaters, copper plates, DC powers, and temperature controllers. The
photolithography and bulk etching technologies were utilized to construct the
thin-film heater and DNA reaction chambers. Finally, 1 pound gL 100bp DNA
segment of E. coli K12 was amplified successfully within 36 minutes on this PCR
platform.

  (http://irevues.inist.fr/tima-editions)</comments><proxy>ccsd hal-00189294</proxy><journal-ref>Dans Symposium on Design, Test, Integration and Packaging of
  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2006, Stresa, Lago Maggiore : Italie (2006)</journal-ref><abstract>  This paper presents results about fabrication and operation of electrostatic
actuators in liquids with various permittivities. In the static mode, we
provide experimental and theoretical demonstration that the pull-in effect can
be shifted beyond one third of the initial gap and even be eliminated when
electrostatic actuators are operated in liquids. This should benefit to
applications in microfluidics requiring either binary state actuation (e.g.
pumps, valves) or continuous displacements over the whole gap (e.g.
microtweezers). In dynamic mode, actuators like micro-cantilevers present a
great interest for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in liquids. As this
application requires a good understanding of the cantilever resonance frequency
and Q-factor, an analytical modeling in liquid environment has been
established. The theoretically derived curves are validated by experimental
results using a nitride encapsulated cantilever with integrated electrostatic
actuation. Electrode potential screening and undesirable electrochemistry in
dielectric liquids are counteracted using AC-voltages. Both experimental and
theoretical results should prove useful in micro-cantilever design for AFM in
liquids.

used, a co-electroplating method of eutectic Au-Sn alloy was used in this
study. Using a co-electroplating process, it was possible to plate the Au-Sn
solder directly onto a wafer at or near the eutectic composition from a single
solution. Two distinct phases, Au5Sn and AuSn, were deposited at a composition
of 30at.%Sn. The Au-Sn flip-chip joints were formed at 300 and 400 degrees
without using any flux. In the case where the samples were reflowed at 300
degrees, only an (Au,Ni)3Sn2 IMC layer formed at the interface between the
Au-Sn solder and Ni UBM. On the other hand, two IMC layers, (Au,Ni)3Sn2 and
(Au,Ni)3Sn, were found at the interfaces of the samples reflowed at 400
degrees. As the reflow time increased, the thickness of the (Au,Ni)3Sn2 and
(Au,Ni)3Sn IMC layers formed at the interface increased and the eutectic
lamellae in the bulk solder coarsened.

Ratio (SNR), the electrical performance of the RF coil is critical. We
developed a device (microcoil) based on the original concept of monolithic
resonator. This paper presents the used fabrication process based on
micromoulding. The dielectric substrates are flexible thin films of polymer,
which allow the microcoil to be form fitted to none-plane surface. Electrical
characterizations of the RF coils are first performed and results are compared
to the attempted values. Proton MRI of a saline phantom using a flexible RF
coil of 15 mm in diameter is performed. When the coil is conformed to the
phantom surface, a SNR gain up to 2 is achieved as compared to identical but
planar RF coil. Finally, the flexible coil is used in vivo to perform MRI with
high spatial resolution on a mouse using a small animal dedicated scanner
operating at in a 2.35 T.

decrease the sensitiveness to fiber-mirror alignment we are developing novel
optical devices based on stressed-metal cantilever-type geometry that allow
deflections up to 50 $\mu$m with increased reflectivity discrimination during

thin film was spun onto a silicon wafer and dried in oven. Photoresist AZ4620
was used to pattern micro-columns with different diameters 60, 70 and 80

This method provides a simple fabrication process and low material cost.

micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based on an advanced numerical
methodology. MEMS are very small devices in which electric as well as
mechanical and fluid phenomena appear and interact. Because of their
microscopic scale, strong coupling effects arise between the different physical
fields, and some forces, which were negligible at macroscopic scale, have to be
taken into account. In order to accurately design such micro-electro-mechanical
systems, it is of primary importance to be able to handle the strong coupling
between the electric and the mechanical fields. In this paper, the finite
element method (FEM) is used to model the strong coupled electro-mechanical
interactions and to perform static and transient analyses taking into account
large mesh displacements. These analyses will be used to study the behaviour of
electrostatically actuated micro-mirrors.

mechanical properties of thin metallic films. The actuator is a beam undergoing
large internal stresses built up during the deposition process. Al thin films
are deposited partly on the actuator beam and on the substrate. By etching the
structure, the actuator contracts and pulls the Al film. Full stress strain
curves can be generated by designing a set of micromachines with various

scanning electronic microscopy. The stress is derived from simple continuum
mechanics relationships. The tensile properties of Al films of various
thicknesses have been tested. A marked increase of the strength with decreasing

polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) revealed a steep glass transition over a 20 oC
range, with the material losing more than 95 % of its storage modulus. The data
explained the hot embossing results which showed large change in the embossed
channel dimensions when the temperature is within the glass transition range.
It was demonstrated that the micro-printing of silver epoxy is a possible
low-cost technique in the mass production of disposable lab chips. An
interconnecting network of electrical traces was fabricated in the form of a
four-layer PMMA-based device. A four PMMA layer device with interconnecting
microfluidic channels was also fabricated and tested.

substrate. However, this research presents a novel manufacture method that is
derived from conventional hot embossing technology to fabricate the
electrostatic switches on polymer material. The procedures of fabrication
involve the metal deposition, photolithography, electroplating, hot embossing
and hot embed techniques. The fundamental concept of the hot embed technology
is that the temperature should be increased above Tg of polymer, and the
polymer becomes plastic and viscous and could be molded. According to the
fundamental concept, the metal layer on the silicon/glass substrate could be
embedded into polymer material during the hot embossing process. Afterward, the
metal layer is bonded together with the polymer after removing the substrate in
the de-embossing step. Finally, the electrostatic switch is fabricated on
polymethylmethacrylate(PMMA) material to demonstrate the novel method.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2006, Stresa, Lago Maggiore : Italie (2006)</journal-ref><abstract>  Fringing field has to be taken into account in the formulation of
electrostatic parallel-plate actuators when the gap separating the electrodes
is comparable to the geometrical dimensions of the moving plate. Even in this
case, the existing formulations often result in complicated mathematical models
from which it is difficult to determine the deflection of the moving plate for
given voltages and therefore to predict the necessary applied voltages for
actuation control. This work presents a new method for the modeling of fringing
field, in which the effect of fringing field is modeled as a serial capacitor.
Numerical simulation demonstrates the suitability of this formulation. Based on
this model, a robust control scheme is constructed using the theory of
input-to-state stabilization (ISS) and back-stepping state feedback design. The
stability and the performance of the system using this control scheme are
demonstrated through both stability analysis and numerical simulation.

dealing with massive data sets, but many of the best compression algorithms --
e.g., those based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform -- at first seem
incompatible with streaming. In this paper we consider several popular
streaming models and ask in which, if any, we can compress as well as we can
with the BWT. We first prove a nearly tight tradeoff between memory and
redundancy for the Standard, Multipass and W-Streams models, demonstrating a
bound that is achievable with the BWT but unachievable in those models. We then
show we can compute the related Schindler Transform in the StreamSort model and
the BWT in the Read-Write model and, thus, achieve that bound.

  Consference (LREC) - Morphological annotation of Korean with Directly
  Maintainable Resources, Genoa : Italie (2006)</journal-ref><abstract>  This article describes an exclusively resource-based method of morphological
annotation of written Korean text. Korean is an agglutinative language. Our
annotator is designed to process text before the operation of a syntactic
parser. In its present state, it annotates one-stem words only. The output is a
graph of morphemes annotated with accurate linguistic information. The
granularity of the tagset is 3 to 5 times higher than usual tagsets. A
comparison with a reference annotated corpus showed that it achieves 89% recall
without any corpus training. The language resources used by the system are
lexicons of stems, transducers of suffixes and transducers of generation of
allomorphs. All can be easily updated, which allows users to control the
evolution of the performances of the system. It has been claimed that
morphological annotation of Korean text could only be performed by a
morphological analysis module accessing a lexicon of morphemes. We show that it
can also be performed directly with a lexicon of words and without applying
morphological rules at annotation time, which speeds up annotation to 1,210
word/s. The lexicon of words is obtained from the maintainable language
resources through a fully automated compilation process.

  We are researching the interaction between the rule and the ontology layers
of the Semantic Web, by comparing two options: 1) using OWL and its rule
extension SWRL to develop an integrated ontology/rule language, and 2) layering
rules on top of an ontology with RuleML and OWL. Toward this end, we are
developing the SWORIER system, which enables efficient automated reasoning on
ontologies and rules, by translating all of them into Prolog and adding a set
of general rules that properly capture the semantics of OWL. We have also
enabled the user to make dynamic changes on the fly, at run time. This work
addresses several of the concerns expressed in previous work, such as negation,
complementary classes, disjunctive heads, and cardinality, and it discusses
alternative approaches for dealing with inconsistencies in the knowledge base.
In addition, for efficiency, we implemented techniques called
extensionalization, avoiding reanalysis, and code minimization.

has developed XML formats compatible with the emerging international standards,

adopt the self-similarity of images to compress the size of images. However,
till now, no solutions for the security of fractal encoded images have been
provided. In this paper, a secure fractal image coding scheme is proposed and
evaluated, which encrypts some of the fractal parameters during fractal
encoding, and thus, produces the encrypted and encoded image. The encrypted
image can only be recovered by the correct key. To keep secure and efficient,
only the suitable parameters are selected and encrypted through in-vestigating
the properties of various fractal parameters, including parameter space,
parameter distribu-tion and parameter sensitivity. The encryption process does
not change the file format, keeps secure in perception, and costs little time
or computational resources. These properties make it suitable for secure image
encoding or transmission.

the reliability of communication over wireless channels. While space-time codes
have initially been designed with a focus on open-loop systems, recent
technological advances have enabled the possibility of low-rate feedback from
the receiver to the transmitter. The focus of this paper is on the implications
of this feedback in a single-user multi-antenna system with a general model for
spatial correlation. We assume a limited feedback model, that is, a coherent
receiver and statistics along with B bits of quantized channel information at
the transmitter. We study space-time coding with a family of linear dispersion
(LD) codes that meet an additional orthogonality constraint so as to ensure
low-complexity decoding. Our results show that, when the number of bits of
feedback (B) is small, a space-time coding scheme that is equivalent to
beamforming and does not code across time is optimal in a weak sense in that it
maximizes the average received SNR. As B increases, this weak optimality
transitions to optimality in a strong sense which is characterized by the
maximization of the average mutual information. Thus, from a system designer's
perspective, our work suggests that beamforming may not only be attractive from
a low-complexity viewpoint, but also from an information-theoretic viewpoint.

phenomenon of the code-bloat in the field of evolutionary computations show a
striking similarity. This seems to suggest that (in the presence of mechanisms
of code growth) the evolution of a complex code can't be attained without
maintaining a large inactive fraction. To test this hypothesis we performed
computer simulations of an evolutionary toy model for Turing machines, studying
the relations among fitness and coding/non-coding ratio while varying mutation
and code growth rates. The results suggest that, in our model, having a large
reservoir of non-coding states constitutes a great (long term) evolutionary
advantage.

  1574-1585, 2007</journal-ref><doi>10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602308</doi><abstract>  This paper proposes a new memetic evolutionary algorithm to achieve explicit
learning in rule-based nurse rostering, which involves applying a set of
heuristic rules for each nurse's assignment. The main framework of the
algorithm is an estimation of distribution algorithm, in which an ant-miner
methodology improves the individual solutions produced in each generation.
Unlike our previous work (where learning is implicit), the learning in the
memetic estimation of distribution algorithm is explicit, i.e. we are able to
identify building blocks directly. The overall approach learns by building a
probabilistic model, i.e. an estimation of the probability distribution of
individual nurse-rule pairs that are used to construct schedules. The local
search processor (i.e. the ant-miner) reinforces nurse-rule pairs that receive
higher rewards. A challenging real world nurse rostering problem is used as the
test problem. Computational results show that the proposed approach outperforms
most existing approaches. It is suggested that the learning methodologies
suggested in this paper may be applied to other scheduling problems where
schedules are built systematically according to specific rules

data clustering. These methods need to solve the eigenproblem whose
computational complexity is $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of data samples.
In this paper, a non-eigenproblem based clustering method is proposed to deal
with the clustering problem. Its performance is comparable to the spectral
clustering algorithms but it is more efficient with computational complexity
$O(n^2)$. We show that with a transitive distance and an observed property,
called K-means duality, our algorithm can be used to handle data sets with
complex cluster shapes, multi-scale clusters, and noise. Moreover, no
parameters except the number of clusters need to be set in our algorithm.

for the representation of evolutionary events acting at the population level,
like recombination between genes, hybridization between lineages, and lateral
gene transfer. While most phylogenetics tools implement a wide range of
algorithms on phylogenetic trees, there exist only a few applications to work
with phylogenetic networks, and there are no open-source libraries either.
  In order to improve this situation, we have developed a Perl package that
relies on the BioPerl bundle and implements many algorithms on phylogenetic
networks. We have also developed a Java applet that makes use of the
aforementioned Perl package and allows the user to make simple experiments with
phylogenetic networks without having to develop a program or Perl script by
herself.
  The Perl package has been accepted as part of the BioPerl bundle. It can be
downloaded from http://dmi.uib.es/~gcardona/BioInfo/Bio-PhyloNetwork.tgz. The
web-based application is available at http://dmi.uib.es/~gcardona/BioInfo/. The
Perl package includes full documentation of all its features.

effect in some research areas. The float-point operation complies with the
reproduce theorem without the external random perturbation. The computation
uncertainty principle and the high nonlinear of chaotic system guarantee the
numerical error is random and departure from the analytical result. Combining
these two properties we can produce unilateral one-way function and provide a
case of utilizing this function to construct encryption algorithm. The
multiple-precision (MP) library is used to analyze nonlinear dynamics systems
and achieve the code. As an example, we provide a scheme of encrypting a
plaintext by employing the one-way function with Lorenz system. Since the
numerical solution used in this scheme is beyond the maximum effective
computation time (MECT) and it cannot satisfy the requirements of return-map
analysis and phase space reconstruction, it can block some existing attacks.

resume correct behavior starting from an arbitrary initial state. Weaker
guarantees have later been introduced to cope with impossibility results:
probabilistic stabilization only gives probabilistic convergence to a correct
behavior. Also, weak stabilization only gives the possibility of convergence.
In this paper, we investigate the relative power of weak, self, and
probabilistic stabilization, with respect to the set of problems that can be
solved. We formally prove that in that sense, weak stabilization is strictly
stronger that self-stabilization. Also, we refine previous results on weak
stabilization to prove that, for practical schedule instances, a deterministic
weak-stabilizing protocol can be turned into a probabilistic self-stabilizing
one. This latter result hints at more practical use of weak-stabilization, as
such algorthms are easier to design and prove than their (probabilistic)
self-stabilizing counterparts.

evaluate different classifiers. Although the conventional performance indexes,
such as accuracy, are commonly used in classifier selection or evaluation,
information-based criteria, such as mutual information, are becoming popular in
feature/model selections. In this work, we propose to assess classifiers in
terms of normalized mutual information (NI), which is novel and well defined in
a compact range for classifier evaluation. We derive close-form relations of
normalized mutual information with respect to accuracy, precision, and recall
in binary classifications. By exploring the relations among them, we reveal
that NI is actually a set of nonlinear functions, with a concordant
power-exponent form, to each performance index. The relations can also be
expressed with respect to precision and recall, or to false alarm and hitting
rate (recall).

complex process which requires the acquisition of various kinds of knowledge

learner to acquire these skills we propose an enhanced, electronic version of
an age old method: pattern drills (henceforth PDs). While being highly regarded
in the fifties, PDs have become unpopular since then, partially because of
their lack of grounding (natural context) and rigidity. Despite these
shortcomings we do believe in the virtues of this approach, at least with
regard to the acquisition of basic linguistic reflexes or skills (automatisms),
necessary to survive in the new language. Of course, the method needs
improvement, and we will show here how this can be achieved. Unlike tapes or
books, computers are open media, allowing for dynamic changes, taking users'
performances and preferences into account. Building an electronic version of
PDs amounts to building an open resource, accomodatable to the users' ever
changing needs.

  This final version has been submitted for journal publication</comments><acm-class>F.2.2; G.3</acm-class><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The restless bandit problem is one of the most well-studied generalizations
of the celebrated stochastic multi-armed bandit problem in decision theory. In
its ultimate generality, the restless bandit problem is known to be PSPACE-Hard
to approximate to any non-trivial factor, and little progress has been made
despite its importance in modeling activity allocation under uncertainty.
  We consider a special case that we call Feedback MAB, where the reward
obtained by playing each of n independent arms varies according to an
underlying on/off Markov process whose exact state is only revealed when the
arm is played. The goal is to design a policy for playing the arms in order to
maximize the infinite horizon time average expected reward. This problem is
also an instance of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and
is widely studied in wireless scheduling and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
routing. Unlike the stochastic MAB problem, the Feedback MAB problem does not
admit to greedy index-based optimal policies.
  We develop a novel and general duality-based algorithmic technique that
yields a surprisingly simple and intuitive 2+epsilon-approximate greedy policy
to this problem. We then define a general sub-class of restless bandit problems
that we term Monotone bandits, for which our policy is a 2-approximation. Our
technique is robust enough to handle generalizations of these problems to
incorporate various side-constraints such as blocking plays and switching
costs. This technique is also of independent interest for other restless bandit
problems. By presenting the first (and efficient) O(1) approximations for
non-trivial instances of restless bandits as well as of POMDPs, our work
initiates the study of approximation algorithms in both these contexts.

search (LAS) multiuser detectors is analyzed. An upper bound on the BER of any
LAS detector is obtained by bounding the fixed point region with the worst
initial detector. The concept of indecomposable errors developed by Verdu is
applied to tighten the upper bound. In a special instance, the upper bound is
reduced to that for all the local maximum likelihood detectors. The upper bound
is comparable with that of the optimum detector obtained by Verdu. A lower
bound on the asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME) is then obtained. It is
shown that there are nontrivial CDMA channels such that a LAS detector can
achieve unit AME regardless of user number. The AME lower bound provides a
means for further seeking a good set of spreading sequences and power
distribution for spectral and power efficient CDMA.

links)
  \emph{and} noisy channels. Consensus with noise in the network links leads to
the bias-variance dilemma--running consensus for long reduces the bias of the
final average estimate but increases its variance. We present two different
compromises to this tradeoff: the $\mathcal{A-ND}$ algorithm modifies
conventional consensus by forcing the weights to satisfy a \emph{persistence}
condition (slowly decaying to zero); and the $\mathcal{A-NC}$ algorithm where
the weights are constant but consensus is run for a fixed number of iterations
$\hat{\imath}$, then it is restarted and rerun for a total of $\hat{p}$ runs,
and at the end averages the final states of the $\hat{p}$ runs (Monte Carlo
averaging). We use controlled Markov processes and stochastic approximation
arguments to prove almost sure convergence of $\mathcal{A-ND}$ to the desired
average (asymptotic unbiasedness) and compute explicitly the m.s.e. (variance)
of the consensus limit. We show that $\mathcal{A-ND}$ represents the best of
both worlds--low bias and low variance--at the cost of a slow convergence rate;

selected maliciously by an adversary. Fixed-blocklength coding assumes a
worst-case bound on the adversary's capabilities, which leads to pessimistic
results. This paper defines a variable-length perspective on this problem, for
which achievable rates are shown that depend on the realized actions of the
adversary. Specifically, rateless codes are constructed which require a limited
amount of common randomness. These codes are constructed for two kinds of AVC
models. In the first the channel state cannot depend on the channel input, and
in the second it can. As a byproduct, the randomized coding capacity of the AVC
with state depending on the transmitted codeword is found and shown to be
achievable with a small amount of common randomness. The results for this model
are proved using a randomized strategy based on list decoding.

network coding. Possible error mechanism include node- or link- failures,
Byzantine behavior of nodes, or an over-estimate of the network min-cut.
Building on the work of Koetter and Kschischang, we introduce a probabilistic
model for errors. We compute the capacity of this channel and we define an
error-correction scheme based on random sparse graphs and a low-complexity
decoding algorithm. By optimizing over the code degree profile, we show that
this construction achieves the channel capacity in complexity which is jointly
quadratic in the number of coded information bits and sublogarithmic in the
error probability.

  Computing Work Flows</title><categories>cs.DC</categories><abstract>  Volunteer Computing, sometimes called Public Resource Computing, is an
emerging computational model that is very suitable for work-pooled parallel
processing. As more complex grid applications make use of work flows in their
design and deployment it is reasonable to consider the impact of work flow
deployment over a Volunteer Computing infrastructure. In this case, the inter
work flow I/O can lead to a significant increase in I/O demands at the work
pool server. A possible solution is the use of a Peer-to- Peer based parallel
computing architecture to off-load this I/O demand to the workers; where the
workers can fulfill some aspects of work flow coordination and I/O checking,
etc. However, achieving robustness in such a large scale system is a
challenging hurdle towards the decentralized execution of work flows and
general parallel processes. To increase robustness, we propose and show the
merits of using an adaptive checkpoint scheme that efficiently checkpoints the
status of the parallel processes according to the estimation of relevant
network and peer parameters. Our scheme uses statistical data observed during
runtime to dynamically make checkpoint decisions in a completely de-
centralized manner. The results of simulation show support for our proposed
approach in terms of reduced required runtime.

+ m items: n raters and m objects. Each rater evaluates a subset of objects
leading to a n x m rating matrix with a certain sparsity pattern. From this
rating matrix we give a nonlinear formula to define the reputation of raters
and objects. We also provide an iterative algorithm that superlinearly
converges to the unique vector of reputations and this for any rating matrix.
In contrast to classical outliers detection, no evaluation is discarded in this
method but each one is taken into account with different weights for the
reputation of the objects. The complexity of one iteration step is linear in
the number of evaluations, making our algorithm efficient for large data set.
Experiments show good robustness of the reputation of the objects against
cheaters and spammers and good detection properties of cheaters and spammers.

directed outwards from the root. We consider the problem of deciding whether a
given directed graph D has an out-branching with at least k leaves (Directed
Spanning k-Leaf). We prove that this problem is fixed parameter tractable, when
k is chosen as the parameter. Previously this was only known for restricted
classes of directed graphs.
  The main new ingredient in our approach is a lemma that shows that given a
locally optimal out-branching of a directed graph in which every arc is part of
at least one out-branching, either an out-branching with at least k leaves
exists, or a path decomposition with width O(k^3) can be found. This enables a
dynamic programming based algorithm of running time 2^{O(k^3 \log k)} n^{O(1)},
where n=|V(D)|.

presentation of the Byrd box model. The approach accounts for the semantics of
Prolog tracers independently of a particular Prolog implementation. Prolog
traces are, in general, considered as rather obscure and difficult to use. The
proposed formal presentation of its trace constitutes a simple and pedagogical
approach for teaching Prolog or for implementing Prolog tracers. It is a form
of declarative specification for the tracers. The trace model introduced here
is only one example to illustrate general problems relating to tracers and
observing processes. Observing processes know, from observed processes, only
their traces. The issue is then to be able to reconstitute, by the sole
analysis of the trace, part of the behaviour of the observed process, and if
possible, without any loss of information. As a matter of fact, our approach
highlights qualities of the Prolog resolution box model which made its success,
but also its insufficiencies.

set of classical books written in English. We study the impact that these
distortions have upon the Kolmogorov complexity and the clustering by
compression technique (the latter based on Normalized Compression Distance,
NCD). We show how to decrease the complexity of the considered books
introducing several modifications in them. We measure how the information
contained in each book is maintained using a clustering error measure. We find
experimentally that the best way to keep the clustering error is by means of
modifications in the most frequent words. We explain the details of these
information distortions and we compare with other kinds of modifications like
random word distortions and unfrequent word distortions. Finally, some
phenomenological explanations from the different empirical results that have
been carried out are presented.

  Processing</comments><abstract>  Tagging communities represent a subclass of a broader class of user-generated
content-sharing online communities. In such communities users introduce and tag
content for later use. Although recent studies advocate and attempt to harness
social knowledge in this context by exploiting collaboration among users,
little research has been done to quantify the current level of user
collaboration in these communities. This paper introduces two metrics to
quantify the level of collaboration: content reuse and shared interest. Using
these two metrics, this paper shows that the current level of collaboration in
CiteULike and Connotea is consistently low, which significantly limits the
potential of harnessing the social knowledge in communities. This study also
discusses implications of these findings in the context of recommendation and
reputation systems.

coding sense) as well as a number of related concepts. We show that the entropy
of a directed graph is identical to its guessing number and can be bounded from
below with the number of vertices minus the size of the graph's shortest index
code. We show that the Network Coding solvability of each specific multiple
unicast network is completely determined by the entropy (as well as by the
shortest index code) of the directed graph that occur by identifying each
source node with each corresponding target node.
  Shannon's information inequalities can be used to calculate upper bounds on a
graph's entropy as well as calculating the size of the minimal index code.
Recently, a number of new families of so-called non-shannon-type information
inequalities have been discovered. It has been shown that there exist
communication networks with a capacity strictly less than required for
solvability, but where this fact cannot be derived using Shannon's classical
information inequalities. Based on this result we show that there exist graphs
with an entropy that cannot be calculated using only Shannon's classical
information inequalities, and show that better estimate can be obtained by use
of certain non-shannon-type information inequalities.

service. The complexity of the translations differ considerably, whereas the
services concerned are equally simple. However, the service concerned in the
case of the simpler translation is far more powerful than the service concerned
in the other case.

are introduced. A software component whose knowledge is replaced by knowware is
called mixware. An object and component oriented development schema of mixware
is introduced. In particular, the tower model and ladder model for mixware

to users contains a random element has recently become a cornerstone of CDMA
research. The random element in the construction is particularly attractive in
that it provides robustness and flexibility in application, whilst not making
significant sacrifices in terms of multiuser efficiency. We present results for
sparse random codes of two types, with and without modulation. Simple
microscopic consideration on system samples would suggest differences in the
phase space of the two models, but we demonstrate that the thermodynamic
results and metastable states are equivalent in the minimum bit error rate
detector. We analyse marginal properties of interactions and also make
analogies to constraint satisfiability problems in order to understand
qualitative features of detection and metastable states. This may have
consequences for developing algorithmic methods to escape metastable states,
thus improving decoding performance.

there is actual similarity. On the other hand, we propose a way to structure a
document database which similarities distance estimation depends on the length
of the selected text. Finally, the experimental evaluations that have been
carried out to study previous problems are shown.

  with Memory</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, November 24,
  2007</comments><abstract>  We consider the problem of minimizing upper bounds and maximizing lower
bounds on information rates of stationary and ergodic discrete-time channels
with memory. The channels we consider can have a finite number of states, such
as partial response channels, or they can have an infinite state-space, such as
time-varying fading channels. We optimize recently-proposed information rate
bounds for such channels, which make use of auxiliary finite-state machine
channels (FSMCs). Our main contribution in this paper is to provide iterative
expectation-maximization (EM) type algorithms to optimize the parameters of the
auxiliary FSMC to tighten these bounds. We provide an explicit, iterative
algorithm that improves the upper bound at each iteration. We also provide an
effective method for iteratively optimizing the lower bound. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithms, we provide several examples of partial
response and fading channels, where the proposed optimization techniques
significantly tighten the initial upper and lower bounds. Finally, we compare
our results with an improved variation of the \emph{simplex} local optimization
algorithm, called \emph{Soblex}. This comparison shows that our proposed
algorithms are superior to the Soblex method, both in terms of robustness in
finding the tightest bounds and in computational efficiency. Interestingly,
from a channel coding/decoding perspective, optimizing the lower bound is
related to increasing the achievable mismatched information rate, i.e., the
information rate of a communication system where the decoder at the receiver is
matched to the auxiliary channel, and not to the original channel.

  Cognitive Radio Networks</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Extension of IEEE PIMRC 2007. 35 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to IEEE
  Journal of Special Topics in Signal Processing, special issue on Signal
  Processing and Networking for Dynamic Spectrum Access</comments><doi>10.1109/JSTSP.2007.914894</doi><abstract>  In cognitive radio (CR) networks, there are scenarios where the secondary
(lower priority) users intend to communicate with each other by
opportunistically utilizing the transmit spectrum originally allocated to the
existing primary (higher priority) users. For such a scenario, a secondary user
usually has to trade off between two conflicting goals at the same time: one is
to maximize its own transmit throughput; and the other is to minimize the
amount of interference it produces at each primary receiver. In this paper, we
study this fundamental tradeoff from an information-theoretic perspective by
characterizing the secondary user's channel capacity under both its own
transmit-power constraint as well as a set of interference-power constraints
each imposed at one of the primary receivers. In particular, this paper
exploits multi-antennas at the secondary transmitter to effectively balance
between spatial multiplexing for the secondary transmission and interference
avoidance at the primary receivers. Convex optimization techniques are used to
design algorithms for the optimal secondary transmit spatial spectrum that
achieves the capacity of the secondary transmission. Suboptimal solutions for
ease of implementation are also presented and their performances are compared
with the optimal solution. Furthermore, algorithms developed for the
single-channel transmission are also extended to the case of multi-channel
transmission whereby the secondary user is able to achieve opportunistic
spectrum sharing via transmit adaptations not only in space, but in time and
frequency domains as well.

FORTRAN95, and its adjoint code needs to be rebuilt. For earlier versions, the
adjoint of OPA was written by hand at a high development cost. We use the
Automatic Differentiation tool TAPENADE to build mechanicaly the tangent and

divided differences, and also with an identical twin experiment. We apply
state-of-the-art methods to improve the performance of the adjoint code. In

texts, with an application to the Polish language. The first novel technique,
the EM selection algorithm, performs unsupervised disambiguation of valence
frame forests, obtained by applying a non-probabilistic deep grammar parser and
some post-processing to the text. The second new idea concerns filtering of
incorrect frames detected in the parsed text and is motivated by an observation
that verbs which take similar arguments tend to have similar frames. This
phenomenon is described in terms of newly introduced co-occurrence matrices.
Using co-occurrence matrices, we split filtering into two steps. The list of
valid arguments is first determined for each verb, whereas the pattern
according to which the arguments are combined into frames is computed in the
following stage. Our best extracted dictionary reaches an $F$-score of 45%,
compared to an $F$-score of 39% for the standard frame-based BHT filtering.

will be generated. Here it is suggested that the cause for a spontaneous
generation of complex systems is probability driven processes. Based on
equilibrium thermodynamics, it is argued that in low occupation number
statistical systems, the second law of thermodynamics yields an increase of
thermal entropy and a canonic energy distribution. However, in high occupation
number statistical systems, the same law for the same reasons yields an
increase of information and a Benford's law/power-law energy distribution. It
is therefore, plausible, that eventually the heat death is not necessarily the
end of the universe.

regularities with respect to their structure. It allows a representation of a
general class of objects including geometric patterns and images in a sparse,
modular, hierarchical, and recursive manner. The representation can exploit any
computable regularity in objects to compactly describe them, while also being
capable of representing random objects as raw data. A set of rules uniformly
dictates the interpretation of the representation into raw signal, which makes
it possible to ask what pattern a given raw signal contains. Also, it allows
simple separation of the information that we wish to ignore from that which we
measure, by using a set of maps to delineate the a priori parts of the objects,
leaving only the information in the structure.
  Using the representation, we introduce a measure of information in general
objects relative to structures defined by the set of maps. We point out that
the common prescription of encoding objects by strings to use Kolmogorov
complexity is meaningless when, as often is the case, the encoding is not
specified in any way other than that it exists. Noting this, we define the
measure directly in terms of the structures of the spaces in which the objects
reside. As a result, the measure is defined relative to a set of maps that
characterize the structures. It turns out that the measure is equivalent to
Kolmogorov complexity when it is defined relative to the maps characterizing
the structure of natural numbers. Thus, the formulation gives the larger class
of objects a meaningful measure of information that generalizes Kolmogorov
complexity.

makes pedicle screw insertion a delicate operation. The aim of the current
paper is to describe a computer-assisted surgical navigation system based on
fluoroscopic X-ray image calibration and three-dimensional optical localizers
in order to reduce radiation exposure while increasing accuracy and reliability
of the surgical procedure for pedicle screw insertion. Instrumentation using
transpedicular screw fixation was performed: in a first group, a conventional
surgical procedure was carried out with 26 patients (138 screws); in a second
group, a navigated surgical procedure (virtual fluoroscopy) was performed with
26 patients (140 screws). Evaluation of screw placement in every case was done
by using plain X-rays and post-operative computer tomography scan. A 5 per cent
cortex penetration (7 of 140 pedicle screws) occurred for the computer-assisted
group. A 13 per cent penetration (18 of 138 pedicle screws) occurred for the
non computer-assisted group. The radiation running time for each vertebra level
(two screws) reached 3.5 s on average in the computer-assisted group and 11.5 s
on average in the non computer-assisted group. The operative time for two
screws on the same vertebra level reaches 10 min on average in the non
computer-assisted group and 11.9 min on average in the computer-assisted group.
The fluoroscopy-based (two-dimensional) navigation system for pedicle screw
insertion is a safe and reliable procedure for surgery in the lower thoracic
and lumbar spine.

  American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine 26, 11 (2007) 1611-6</journal-ref><abstract>  OBJECTIVE: The TER system is a robot-based tele-echography system allowing
remote ultrasound examination. The specialist moves a mock-up of the ultrasound
probe at the master site, and the robot reproduces the movements of the real
probe, which sends back ultrasound images and force feedback. This tool could
be used to perform ultrasound examinations in small health care centers or from
isolated sites. The objective of this study was to prove, under real
conditions, the feasibility and reliability of the TER system in detecting
abdominal aortic and iliac aneurysms. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were
included in 2 centers in Brest and Grenoble, France. The remote examination was
compared with the reference standard, the bedside examination, for aorta and
iliac artery diameter measurement, detection and description of aneurysms,
detection of atheromatosis, the duration of the examination, and acceptability.
RESULTS: All aneurysms (8) were detected by both techniques as intramural
thrombosis and extension to the iliac arteries. The interobserver correlation
coefficient was 0.982 (P &lt; .0001) for aortic diameters. The rate of concordance
between 2 operators in evaluating atheromatosis was 84% +/- 11% (95% confidence
interval). CONCLUSIONS: Our study on 58 patients suggests that the TER system
could be a reliable, acceptable, and effective robot-based system for
performing remote abdominal aortic ultrasound examinations. Research is
continuing to improve the equipment for general abdominal use.

wideband slow-fading channel, modeled as an (asymptotically) large number of
independent identically distributed parallel channels, with the random channel
fading realizations remaining constant over the entire coding block. On the one
hand, in the wideband limit the minimum achievable energy per nat required for
reliable transmission, as a random variable, converges in probability to
certain deterministic quantity. On the other hand, the exponential decay rate
of the outage probability, termed as the wideband outage exponent,
characterizes how the number of parallel channels, {\it i.e.}, the
``bandwidth'', should asymptotically scale in order to achieve a target outage
probability at a target energy per nat. We examine two scenarios: when the
transmitter has no channel state information and adopts uniform transmit power
allocation among parallel channels; and when the transmitter is endowed with an
one-bit channel state feedback for each parallel channel and accordingly
allocates its transmit power. For both scenarios, we evaluate the wideband
minimum energy per nat and the wideband outage exponent, and discuss their
implication for system performance.

of their commercial Type-of-Relationships (ToR) has been extensively studied
during the last few years. The main motivation is to accurately calculate
AS-level paths and to provide better topological view of the Internet. An
inherent problem in current algorithms is their extensive use of heuristics.
Such heuristics incur unbounded errors which are spread over all inferred
relationships. We propose a near-deterministic algorithm for solving the ToR
inference problem. Our algorithm uses as input the Internet core, which is a
dense sub-graph of top-level ASes. We test several methods for creating such a
core and demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm to the core's size and
density, the inference period, and errors in the core.
  We evaluate our algorithm using AS-level paths collected from RouteViews BGP
paths and DIMES traceroute measurements. Our proposed algorithm
deterministically infers over 95% of the approximately 58,000 AS topology
links. The inference becomes stable when using a week worth of data and as
little as 20 ASes in the core. The algorithm infers 2-3 times more peer-to-peer
relationships in edges discovered only by DIMES than in RouteViews edges,
validating the DIMES promise to discover periphery AS edges.

  ISBN:1-905617-08-9</journal-ref><abstract>  Her Majestys Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) was born out of the need to create a UK
tax authority by merging both the Inland Revenue and HM Customs &amp; Excise into
one department. HMRC encounters spreadsheets in tax-payers systems on a very
regular basis as well as being a heavy user of spreadsheets internally. The
approach to spreadsheet risk assessment and spreadsheet audit is by the use of
trained computer auditors and data handlers. This, by definition, limits the
use of our specialist spreadsheet audit tool to such trained staff. In order to
tackle the growing use of spreadsheets, a new way of approaching the problem
has been piloted. The aim is to issue all staff who come across spreadsheets
with a simple to use analysis and risk assessment tool, based on the
departmental software SpACE (Spreadsheet Audit &amp; Compliance Examination).

  ISBN:1-905617-08-09</journal-ref><abstract>  Most organizations today use spreadsheets in some form or another to support
critical business processes. However the financial resources, and developmental
rigor dedicated to them are often minor in comparison to other enterprise
technology. The increasing focus on achieving regulatory and other forms of
compliance over key technology assets has made it clear that organizations must
regard spreadsheets as an enterprise resource and account for them when
developing an overall compliance strategy. This paper provides the reader with
a set of practical strategies for addressing spreadsheet compliance from an
organizational perspective. It then presents capabilities offered in the 2007
Microsoft Office System which can be used to help customers address compliance
challenges.

equations in $n+1$ variables. We propose an algorithm based on Newton's method
and subdivision for this problem. Our algorithm is intended only for
nondegenerate cases, in which case the solution is a 1-dimensional curve. Our
first main contribution is a definition of a condition number measuring
reciprocal distance to degeneracy that can distinguish poor and well
conditioned instances of this problem. (Degenerate problems would be infinitely
ill conditioned in our framework.) Our second contribution, which is the main
novelty of our algorithm, is an analysis showing that its running time is
bounded in terms of the condition number of the problem instance as well as $n$
and the polynomial degrees.

influence the outcome of an election. Faliszewski et al. [FHHR07] proved that
Llull voting (which is here denoted by Copeland^1) and a variant (here denoted
by Copeland^0) of Copeland voting are computationally resistant to many, yet
not all, types of constructive control and that they also provide broad
resistance to bribery. We study a parameterized version of Copeland voting,
denoted by Copeland^alpha where the parameter alpha is a rational number
between 0 and 1 that specifies how ties are valued in the pairwise comparisons
of candidates in Copeland elections. We establish resistance or vulnerability
results, in every previously studied control scenario, for Copeland^alpha, for
each rational alpha, 0 &lt;alpha &lt; 1. In particular, we prove that Copeland^0.5,
the system commonly referred to as ``Copeland voting,'' provides full
resistance to constructive control. Among the systems with a polynomial-time
winner problem, this is the first natural election system proven to have full
resistance to constructive control. Results on bribery and fixed-parameter
tractability of bounded-case control proven for Copeland^0 and Copeland^1 in
[FHHR07] are extended to Copeland^alpha for each rational alpha, 0 &lt; alpha &lt; 1;
we also give results in more flexible models such as microbribery and extended
control.

  Access</comments><doi>10.1109/JSTSP.2007.914890</doi><abstract>  Cognitive radios have been studied recently as a means to utilize spectrum in
a more efficient manner. This paper focuses on the fundamental limits of
operation of a MIMO cognitive radio network with a single licensed user and a
single cognitive user. The channel setting is equivalent to an interference
channel with degraded message sets (with the cognitive user having access to
the licensed user's message). An achievable region and an outer bound is
derived for such a network setting. It is shown that under certain conditions,
the achievable region is optimal for a portion of the capacity region that
includes sum capacity.

graph (directed or undirected), two nodes s,t and a time limit T, find an s-t
walk of total length at most T that maximizes the number of distinct nodes
visited by the walk. One obtains a generalization, namely orienteering with
time-windows (also referred to as TSP with time-windows), if each node v has a
specified time-window [R(v), D(v)] and a node v is counted as visited by the
walk only if v is visited during its time-window. For the time-window problem,
an O(\log \opt) approximation can be achieved even for directed graphs if the
algorithm is allowed quasi-polynomial time. However, the best known polynomial
time approximation ratios are O(\log^2 \opt) for undirected graphs and O(\log^4
\opt) in directed graphs. In this paper we make some progress towards closing
this discrepancy, and in the process obtain improved approximation ratios in
several natural settings. Let L(v) = D(v) - R(v) denote the length of the
time-window for v and let \lmax = \max_v L(v) and \lmin = \min_v L(v). Our
results are given below with \alpha denoting the known approximation ratio for
orienteering (without time-windows). Currently \alpha = (2+\eps) for undirected
graphs and \alpha = O(\log^2 \opt) in directed graphs.
  1. An O(\alpha \log \lmax) approximation when R(v) and D(v) are integer
valued for each v.
  2. An O(\alpha \max{\log \opt, \log \frac{\lmax}{\lmin}}) approximation.
  3. An O(\alpha \log \frac{\lmax}{\lmin}) approximation when no start and end
points are specified.
  In particular, if \frac{\lmax}{\lmin} is poly-bounded, we obtain an O(\log n)
approximation for the time-window problem in undirected graphs.

channel non-causally available at only the relay. In the framework of
cooperative wireless networks, some specific terminals can be equipped with
cognition capabilities, i.e, the relay in our model. In the discrete memoryless
(DM) case, we derive lower and upper bounds on channel capacity. The lower
bound is obtained by a coding scheme at the relay that consists in a
combination of codeword splitting, Gel'fand-Pinsker binning, and a
decode-and-forward scheme. The upper bound is better than that obtained by
assuming that the channel state is available at the source and the destination
as well. For the Gaussian case, we also derive lower and upper bounds on
channel capacity. The lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme which is based
on a combination of codeword splitting and Generalized dirty paper coding. The
upper bound is also better than that obtained by assuming that the channel
state is available at the source, the relay, and the destination. The two
bounds meet, and so give the capacity, in some special cases for the degraded
Gaussian case.

instances of the $K$-satisfiability ($K$-SAT) problem. We introduce a new
stochastic local search algorithm, ChainSAT, which moves in the energy
landscape of a problem instance by {\em never going upwards} in energy.
ChainSAT is a \emph{focused} algorithm in the sense that it considers only
variables occurring in unsatisfied clauses. We show by extensive numerical
investigations that ChainSAT and other focused algorithms solve large $K$-SAT
instances almost surely in linear time, up to high clause-to-variable ratios
$\alpha$; for example, for K=4 we observe linear-time performance well beyond
the recently postulated clustering and condensation transitions in the solution
space. The performance of ChainSAT is a surprise given that by design the
algorithm gets trapped into the first local energy minimum it encounters, yet
no such minima are encountered. We also study the geometry of the solution
space as accessed by stochastic local search algorithms.

endoscope holder for laparoscopic surgery that is small and low cost. MATERIALS
AND METHODS: A compact light endoscope robot (LER) that is placed on the
patient's skin and can be used with the patient in the lateral or dorsal supine
position was tested on cadavers and laboratory pigs in order to allow
successive modifications. The current control system is based on voice
recognition. The range of vision is 360 degrees with an angle of 160 degrees .
Twenty-three procedures were performed. RESULTS: The tests made it possible to
advance the prototype on a variety of aspects, including reliability,
steadiness, ergonomics, and dimensions. The ease of installation of the robot,
which takes only 5 minutes, and the easy handling made it possible for 21 of
the 23 procedures to be performed without an assistant. CONCLUSION: The LER is
a camera holder guided by the surgeon's voice that can eliminate the need for
an assistant during laparoscopic surgery. The ease of installation and
manufacture should make it an effective and inexpensive system for use on
patients in the lateral and dorsal supine positions. Randomized clinical trials
will soon validate a new version of this robot prior to marketing.

  revised version</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We consider a multi-channel opportunistic communication system where the
states of these channels evolve as independent and statistically identical
Markov chains (the Gilbert-Elliot channel model). A user chooses one channel to
sense and access in each slot and collects a reward determined by the state of
the chosen channel. The problem is to design a sensing policy for channel
selection to maximize the average reward, which can be formulated as a
multi-arm restless bandit process. In this paper, we study the structure,
optimality, and performance of the myopic sensing policy. We show that the
myopic sensing policy has a simple robust structure that reduces channel
selection to a round-robin procedure and obviates the need for knowing the
channel transition probabilities. The optimality of this simple policy is
established for the two-channel case and conjectured for the general case based
on numerical results. The performance of the myopic sensing policy is analyzed,
which, based on the optimality of myopic sensing, characterizes the maximum
throughput of a multi-channel opportunistic communication system and its
scaling behavior with respect to the number of channels. These results apply to
cognitive radio networks, opportunistic transmission in fading environments,
and resource-constrained jamming and anti-jamming.

In contrast to previous results, our new expressions apply for systems with

  Algorithms</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><abstract>  We study the effects of finite-precision representation of source's
probabilities on the efficiency of classic source coding algorithms, such as
Shannon, Gilbert-Moore, or arithmetic codes. In particular, we establish the
following simple connection between the redundancy $R$ and the number of bits
$W$ necessary for representation of source's probabilities in computer's memory
($R$ is assumed to be small): \begin{equation*} W \lesssim \eta \log_2
\frac{m}{R}, \end{equation*} where $m$ is the cardinality of the source's
alphabet, and $\eta \leqslant 1$ is an implementation-specific constant. In
case of binary alphabets ($m=2$) we show that there exist codes for which $\eta
= 1/2$, and in $m$-ary case ($m &gt; 2$) we show that there exist codes for which
$\eta = m/(m+1)$. In general case, however (which includes designs relying on
progressive updates of frequency counters), we show that $\eta = 1$. Usefulness
of these results for practical designs of source coding algorithms is also
discussed.

  Bernoulli Source</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><abstract>  The efficiency of a code is estimated by its redundancy $R$, while the
complexity of a code is estimated by its average delay $\bar N$. In this work
we construct word-based codes, for which $R \lesssim \bar N^{-5/3}$. Therefore,
word-based codes can attain the same redundancy as block-codes while being much
less complex.
  We also consider uniform on the output codes, the benefit of which is the
lack of a running synchronization error. For such codes $\bar N^{-1} \lesssim R
\lesssim \bar N^{-1}$, except for a case when all input symbols are
equiprobable, when $R \leqslant \bar N^{-2}$ for infinitely many $\bar N$.

$\{X_n\}_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}$ for which there is a finite $K$ ($K =
K(\{X_n\}_{n=-\infty}^0$) such that the conditional distribution of $X_1$ given
the entire past is equal to the conditional distribution of $X_1$ given only
$\{X_n\}_{n=1-K}^0$. The least such value of $K$ is called the memory length.
We give a rather complete analysis of the problems of universally estimating
the least such value of $K$, both in the backward sense that we have just
described and in the forward sense, where one observes successive values of
$\{X_n\}$ for $n \geq 0$ and asks for the least value $K$ such that the
conditional distribution of $X_{n+1}$ given $\{X_i\}_{i=n-K+1}^n$ is the same
as the conditional distribution of $X_{n+1}$ given $\{X_i\}_{i=-\infty}^n$. We
allow for finite or countably infinite alphabet size.

today. Although improvements are needed throughout the systems development life

Several forms of testing are possible, but logic inspection is recommended for
module testing. Logic inspection appears to be feasible for spreadsheet

characterizing the domain of the transpose of the multiplication. This domain
is the set of what could be called ``representative linear forms'' which are
the elements of the algebraic dual which are also representative on the
multiplicative semigroup of the algebra. When the algebra is free, this notion
is indeed equivalent to that of rational functions of automata theory. For the
sake of applications, the range of coefficients has been considerably
broadened, i.e. extended to semirings, so that the results could be specialized
to the boolean and multiplicity cases. This requires some caution (use of
``positive formulas'', iteration replacing inversion, stable submodules
replacing finite-rank families for instance). For the theory and its
applications has been created a rational calculus which can, in return, be
applied to harness Sweedler's duals. A new theorem of rational closure and
application to Hopf algebras of use in Physics and Combinatorics is provided.
The concrete use of this ``calculus'' is eventually illustrated on an example.

models of $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ (the ``Bayesian similarity measure'') have
been shown to be an optimal similarity measure for nearest neighbor
classification. This paper analyzes demonstrates several additional properties
of that conditional distribution. The paper first shows that we can
reconstruct, up to class labels, the class posterior distribution $P(\omega|x)$
given $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$, gives a procedure for recovering the class
labels, and gives an asymptotically Bayes-optimal classification procedure. It
also shows, given such an optimal similarity measure, how to construct a
classifier that outperforms the nearest neighbor classifier and achieves
Bayes-optimal classification rates. The paper then analyzes Bayesian similarity
in a framework where a classifier faces a number of related classification
tasks (multitask learning) and illustrates that reconstruction of the class
posterior distribution is not possible in general. Finally, the paper
identifies a distinct class of classification problems using
$P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ and shows that using $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ to
solve those problems is the Bayes optimal solution.

formulated either as a function approximation problem of a function describing
the view-manifold of an object, or as that of learning a class-conditional
density. This paper describes an alternative framework for learning in visual
object recognition, that of learning the view-generalization function. Using
the view-generalization function, an observer can perform Bayes-optimal 3D
object recognition given one or more 2D training views directly, without the
need for a separate model acquisition step. The paper shows that view
generalization functions can be computationally practical by restating two
widely-used methods, the eigenspace and linear combination of views approaches,
in a view generalization framework. The paper relates the approach to recent
methods for object recognition based on non-uniform blurring. The paper
presents results both on simulated 3D ``paperclip'' objects and real-world
images from the COIL-100 database showing that useful view-generalization
functions can be realistically be learned from a comparatively small number of
training examples.

Euclidean similarity measurements to compare object views against previously
seen views can achieve the same recognition performance as observers having
access to all coordinate information and able of using arbitrary 3D models
internally. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such systems do not require more
training views than Bayes-optimal 3D model-based systems. For building computer
vision systems, these results imply that using view-based or appearance-based
techniques with carefully constructed combination of evidence mechanisms may
not be at a disadvantage relative to 3D model-based systems. For computational
approaches to human vision, they show that it is impossible to distinguish
view-based and 3D model-based techniques for 3D object recognition solely by
comparing the performance achievable by human and 3D model-based systems.}

first one is a new decidability result in the case of local sentences whose
function symbols are at most unary: one can decide, for every regular cardinal
k whether a local sentence phi has a model of order type k. Secondly we show
that this result can not be extended to the general case. Assuming the
consistency of an inaccessible cardinal we prove that the set of local
sentences having a model of order type omega_2 is not determined by the
axiomatic system ZFC + GCH, where GCH is the generalized continuum hypothesis

  Revised version accepted with minor revisions</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Distributed source coding schemes are typically based on the use of channels
codes as source codes. In this paper we propose a new paradigm, termed
&quot;distributed arithmetic coding&quot;, which exploits the fact that arithmetic codes
are good source as well as channel codes. In particular, we propose a
distributed binary arithmetic coder for Slepian-Wolf coding with decoder side
information, along with a soft joint decoder. The proposed scheme provides
several advantages over existing Slepian-Wolf coders, especially its good
performance at small block lengths, and the ability to incorporate arbitrary
source models in the encoding process, e.g. context-based statistical models.
We have compared the performance of distributed arithmetic coding with turbo
codes and low-density parity-check codes, and found that the proposed approach
has very competitive performance.

  Conference</journal-ref><abstract>  The generation of meaningless &quot;words&quot; matching certain statistical and/or
linguistic criteria is frequently needed for experimental purposes in
Psycholinguistics. Such stimuli receive the name of pseudowords or nonwords in
the Cognitive Neuroscience literatue. The process for building nonwords
sometimes has to be based on linguistic units such as syllables or morphemes,
resulting in a numerical explosion of combinations when the size of the
nonwords is increased. In this paper, a reactive tabu search scheme is proposed
to generate nonwords of variables size. The approach builds pseudowords by
using a modified Metaheuristic algorithm based on a local search procedure
enhanced by a feedback-based scheme. Experimental results show that the new
algorithm is a practical and effective tool for nonword generation.

We base
rewrites on a historical click graph that records the ads that have been
clicked on in response to past user queries. Given a query q, we first consider
Simrank as a way to identify queries similar to q, i.e., queries whose ads a
user may be interested in. We argue that Simrank fails to properly identify
query similarities in our application, and we present two enhanced version of
Simrank: one that exploits weights on click graph edges and another that
exploits ``evidence.'' We experimentally evaluate our new schemes against
Simrank, using actual click graphs and queries form Yahoo!, and using a variety
of metrics. Our results show that the enhanced methods can yield more and
better query rewrites.

of real-time three-dimensional (4-D) ultrasound-guided biopsies on a prostate
phantom. METHODS: A prostate phantom was created. A three-dimensional real-time
ultrasound system with a 5.9MHz probe was used, making it possible to see
several reconstructed orthogonal viewing planes in real time. Fourteen
operators performed biopsies first under 2-D then 4-D transurethral ultrasound
(TRUS) guidance (336 biopsies). The biopsy path was modelled using segmentation
in a 3-D ultrasonographic volume. Special software was used to visualise the
biopsy paths in a reference prostate and assess the sampled area. A comparative
study was performed to examine the accuracy of the entry points and target of
the needle. Distribution was assessed by measuring the volume sampled and a
redundancy ratio of the sampled prostate. RESULTS: A significant increase in
accuracy in hitting the target zone was identified using 4-D ultrasonography as
compared to 2-D. There was no increase in the sampled volume or improvement in
the biopsy distribution with 4-D ultrasonography as compared to 2-D.
CONCLUSION: The 4-D TRUS guidance appears to show, on a synthetic model, an
improvement in location accuracy and in the ability to reproduce a protocol.
The biopsy distribution does not seem improved.
