multiple access channel (MAC) with side information at the sources and the
decoder. Source-channel separation does not hold for this channel. Sufficient
conditions are provided for transmission of sources with a given distortion.
The source and/or the channel could have continuous alphabets (thus Gaussian
sources and Gaussian MACs are special cases). Various previous results are
obtained as special cases. We also provide several good joint source-channel
coding schemes for a discrete/continuous source and discrete/continuous
alphabet channel. Channels with feedback and fading are also considered.
  Keywords: Multiple access channel, side information, lossy joint
source-channel coding, channels with feedback, fading channels.

Gaussian noise channel using randomly spread code division. For a general class
of symmetric distributions for spreading coefficients, in the limit of a large
number of users, we prove an upper bound on the capacity, which matches a
formula that Tanaka obtained by using the replica method. We also show
concentration of various relevant quantities including mutual information,
capacity and free energy. The mathematical methods are quite general and allow
us to discuss extensions to other multiuser scenarios.

flexible, collaborative digital libraries. NCore was developed by the National
Science Digital Library (NSDL) project, and it serves as the central technical
infrastructure for NSDL. NCore consists of a central Fedora-based digital
repository, a specific data model, an API, and a set of backend services and
frontend tools that create a new model for collaborative, contributory digital
libraries. This paper describes NCore, presents and analyzes its architecture,
tools and services; and reports on the experience of NSDL in building and
operating a major digital library on it over the past year and the experience
of the Digital Library for Earth Systems Education in porting their existing
digital library and tools to the NCore platform.

We first define the physically degraded finite-state broadcast channel for
which we derive the capacity region. We then define the stochastically degraded
finite-state broadcast channel and derive the capacity region for this scenario
as well. In both scenarios we consider the non-indecomposable finite-state

  Systems</title><categories>cs.DC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Strong replica consistency is often achieved by writing deterministic
applications, or by using a variety of mechanisms to render replicas
deterministic. There exists a large body of work on how to render replicas
deterministic under the benign fault model. However, when replicas can be
subject to malicious faults, most of the previous work is no longer effective.
Furthermore, the determinism of the replicas is often considered harmful from
the security perspective and for many applications, their integrity strongly
depends on the randomness of some of their internal operations. This calls for
new approaches towards achieving replica consistency while preserving the
replica randomness. In this paper, we present two such approaches. One is based
on Byzantine agreement and the other on threshold coin-tossing. Each approach
has its strength and weaknesses. We compare the performance of the two
approaches and outline their respective best use scenarios.

  Systems</title><categories>cs.DC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper, we describe a novel proactive recovery scheme based on service
migration for long-running Byzantine fault tolerant systems. Proactive recovery
is an essential method for ensuring long term reliability of fault tolerant
systems that are under continuous threats from malicious adversaries. The
primary benefit of our proactive recovery scheme is a reduced vulnerability
window. This is achieved by removing the time-consuming reboot step from the
critical path of proactive recovery. Our migration-based proactive recovery is
coordinated among the replicas, therefore, it can automatically adjust to
different system loads and avoid the problem of excessive concurrent proactive
recoveries that may occur in previous work with fixed watchdog timeouts.
Moreover, the fast proactive recovery also significantly improves the system
availability in the presence of faults.

where the training data is horizontally or vertically distributed. Furthermore,
we consider the same problem in the case where the data is both horizontally
and vertically distributed, a situation we refer to as grid partitioned data.
We give an algorithm for privacy preserving ID3 over horizontally partitioned
data involving more than two parties. For grid partitioned data, we discuss two
different evaluation methods for preserving privacy ID3, namely, first merging
horizontally and developing vertically or first merging vertically and next
developing horizontally. Next to introducing privacy preserving data mining
over grid-partitioned data, the main contribution of this paper is that we
show, by means of a complexity analysis that the former evaluation method is
the more efficient.

Dempster-Shafer can be a promising method for anomaly detection problems with
multiple features (data sources), and two or more classes.

approach is that we intend to use simulation to derive a more realistic
objective function and use Memetic algorithms to find an optimal solution. The
main advantage of using Memetic algorithms is that it combines a local search
with Genetic Algorithms. The Crossdock Door Assignment Problem is a new domain
application to Memetic Algorithms and it is yet unknown how it will perform.

level of accuracy and robustness, and which is able to operate in an
environment with a large number of cameras. Background modeling is based on DCT
coefficients provided by cameras. Foreground detection uses similarity in
temporal characteristics of adjacent blocks of pixels, which is a
computationally inexpensive way to make use of object coherence. Scene model
updating uses the approximated median method for improved performance.
Evaluation at pixel level and application level shows that SAMMI object
detection performs better and faster than the conventional Mixture of Gaussians
method.

technology. The broad objective of our research is to develop a similar
capability within organisational psychology.

principle. For this purpose, we consider a system composed of N peers becoming
active at exponential random times; the system is initiated with only one
server offering the desired file and the other peers after becoming active try
to download it. Once the file has been downloaded by a peer, this one
immediately becomes a server. To investigate the transient behavior of this
file sharing system, we study the instant when the system shifts from a
congested state where all servers available are saturated by incoming demands
to a state where a growing number of servers are idle. In spite of its apparent
simplicity, this queueing model (with a random number of servers) turns out to
be quite difficult to analyze. A formulation in terms of an urn and ball model
is proposed and corresponding scaling results are derived. These asymptotic
results are then compared against simulations.

understanding the world of work. In this paper we describe the development of
an agent-based simulation model, designed to help to understand the
relationship between human resource management practices and retail
productivity. We report on the current development of our simulation model
which includes new features concerning the evolution of customers over time. To
test some of these features we have conducted a series of experiments dealing
with customer pool sizes, standard and noise reduction modes, and the spread of
the word of mouth. Our multi-disciplinary research team draws upon expertise
from work psychologists and computer scientists. Despite the fact we are
working within a relatively novel and complex domain, it is clear that
intelligent agents offer potential for fostering sustainable organisational
capabilities in the future.

immune system in order to produce dynamic systems that can adapt to complex,
varying, real-world tasks. Jernes idiotypic-network theory has proved the most
popular artificial-immune-system (AIS) method for incorporation into
behaviour-based robotics, since idiotypic selection produces highly adaptive
responses. However, previous efforts have mostly focused on evolving the
network connections and have often worked with a single, pre-engineered set of
behaviours, limiting variability. This paper describes a method for encoding
behaviours as a variable set of attributes, and shows that when the encoding is
used with a genetic algorithm (GA), multiple sets of diverse behaviours can
develop naturally and rapidly, providing much greater scope for flexible
behaviour-selection. The algorithm is tested extensively with a simulated
e-puck robot that navigates around a maze by tracking colour. Results show that
highly successful behaviour sets can be generated within about 25 minutes, and
that much greater diversity can be obtained when multiple autonomous
populations are used, rather than a single one.

Model (TAM), along with techniques to work around such limitations.
Specifically, we investigate the self-assembly of fractal shapes in the TAM. We
prove that no self-similar fractal fully weakly self-assembles at temperature
1, and that certain kinds of self-similar fractals do not strictly
self-assemble at any temperature. Additionally, we extend the fiber
construction from Lathrop et. al. (2007) to show that any self-similar fractal
belonging to a particular class of &quot;nice&quot; self-similar fractals has a fibered
version that strictly self-assembles in the TAM.

  Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This study examines the differences between Scopus and Web of Science in the
citation counting, citation ranking, and h-index of 22 top human-computer
interaction (HCI) researchers from EQUATOR--a large British Interdisciplinary
Research Collaboration project. Results indicate that Scopus provides
significantly more coverage of HCI literature than Web of Science, primarily
due to coverage of relevant ACM and IEEE peer-reviewed conference proceedings.
No significant differences exist between the two databases if citations in
journals only are compared. Although broader coverage of the literature does
not significantly alter the relative citation ranking of individual
researchers, Scopus helps distinguish between the researchers in a more nuanced
fashion than Web of Science in both citation counting and h-index. Scopus also
generates significantly different maps of citation networks of individual
scholars than those generated by Web of Science. The study also presents a
comparison of h-index scores based on Google Scholar with those based on the
union of Scopus and Web of Science. The study concludes that Scopus can be used
as a sole data source for citation-based research and evaluation in HCI,
especially if citations in conference proceedings are sought and that h scores
should be manually calculated instead of relying on system calculations.

produce robust schedules in a manufacturing environment. The main goal is to
develop building blocks (antibodies) of partial schedules that can be used to
construct backup solutions (antigens) when disturbances occur during
production. The building blocks are created based upon underpinning ideas from
artificial immune systems and evolved using a genetic algorithm (Phase I). Each
partial schedule (antibody) is assigned a fitness value and the best partial
schedules are selected to be converted into complete schedules (antigens). We
further investigate whether simulated annealing and the great deluge algorithm
can improve the results when hybridised with our artificial immune system
(Phase II). We use ten fixed solutions as our target and measure how well we
cover these specific scenarios.

degrees of freedom (DOF), of cooperation and cognitive message sharing for a
two-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian interference channel
with $M_1$, $M_2$ antennas at transmitters and $N_1$, $N_2$ antennas at
receivers. For the case of cooperation (including cooperation at transmitters
only, at receivers only, and at transmitters as well as receivers), the DOF is
$\min \{M_1+M_2, N_1+N_2, \max(M_1, N_2)), \max(M_2, N_1)\}$, which is the same
as the DOF of the channel without cooperation. For the case of cognitive
message sharing, the DOF is $\min \{M_1+M_2, N_1+N_2, (1-1_{T2})((1-1_{R2})
\max(M_1, N_2) + 1_{R2} (M_1+N_2)), (1-1_{T1})((1-1_{R1}) \max(M_2, N_1) +
1_{R1} (M_2+N_1)) \}$ where $1_{Ti} = 1$ $(0)$ when transmitter $i$ is (is not)
a cognitive transmitter and $1_{Ri}$ is defined in the same fashion. Our
results show that while both techniques may increase the sum rate capacity of
the MIMO interference channel, only cognitive message sharing can increase the
DOF. We also find that it may be more beneficial for a user to have a cognitive
transmitter than to have a cognitive receiver.

technical approach to the near-elimination of spreadsheet risk in the
enterprise computing environment, whilst maintaining the full flexibility of
spreadsheets for modelling complex financial structures and processes. In its
Basic Mode of use, the system comprises a secure and robust centralised
spreadsheet management framework. In Advanced Mode, the system can be viewed as
a robust computational framework whereby users can &quot;submit jobs&quot; to the
spreadsheet, and retrieve the results from the computations, but with no direct
access to the underlying spreadsheet. An example application, Monte Carlo
simulation, is presented to highlight the benefits of this approach with regard
to mitigating spreadsheet risk in complex, mission-critical, financial
calculations.

as high risk yet unrecognised as such by industry. There are numerous software
applications that are designed to audit formulae and find errors. However these
are all post creation, designed to catch errors before the spreadsheet is
deployed. As a general conclusion from EuSpRIG 2003 conference it was decided
that the time has come to attempt novel solutions based on an understanding of
human factors. Hence in this paper we examine one such possibility namely a
novel example driven modelling approach. We discuss a control experiment that
compares example driven modelling against traditional approaches over several
progressively more difficult tests. The results are very interesting and
certainly point to the value of further investigation of the example driven
potential. Lastly we propose a method for statistically analysing the problem
of overconfidence in spreadsheet modellers.

Wireless Sensor Networks. Lower-layers have a major impact on upper-layer
performance, and the complexity of the phenomena can not be entirely captured
by analysis or simulation. In this report, we go through the complete process,
from designing an energy-efficient self-organizing communication architecture
(MAC, routing and application layers) to real-life experimentation roll-outs.
The presented communication architecture includes a MAC protocol which avoids
building and maintaining neighborhood tables, and a geographically-inspired
routing protocol over virtual coordinates. The application consists of a mobile
sink interrogating a wireless sensor network based on the requests issued by a
disconnected base station. After the design process of this architecture, we
verify it functions correctly by simulation, and we perform a temporal
verification. This study is needed to calculate the maximum speed the mobile
sink can take. We detail the implementation, and the results of the off-site
experimentation (energy consumption at PHY layer, collision probability at MAC
layer, and routing). Finally, we report on the real-world deployment where we
have mounted the mobile sink node on a radio-controlled airplane.

binary erasure channel suited for upper-layer error correction. The proposed
algorithm performs on-the-fly decoding, i.e. it starts decoding as soon as the
first symbols are received. This algorithm compares with the iterative decoding
of codes defined on graphs, in that it propagates in the trellises of the turbo
code by removing transitions in the same way edges are removed in a bipartite
graph under message-passing decoding. Performance comparison with LDPC codes
for different coding rates is shown.

by O. Serre in [ Games with Winning Conditions of High Borel Complexity, in the
Proceedings of the International Conference ICALP 2004, LNCS, Volume 3142, p.
1150-1162 ]. We answer in this paper several questions which were raised by
Serre in the above cited paper. We first show that, for every positive integer
n, the class C_n(A), which arises in the definition of decidable winning
conditions, is included in the class of non-ambiguous context free omega
languages, and that it is neither closed under union nor under intersection. We
prove also that there exists pushdown games, equipped with such decidable
winning conditions, where the winning sets are not deterministic context free
languages, giving examples of winning sets which are non-deterministic
non-ambiguous context free languages, inherently ambiguous context free
languages, or even non context free languages.

languages. In particular we show that the class LOC_omega is neither closed
under intersection nor under complementation, giving an answer to a question of

user/programmers are increasingly choosing the MatLab scripting language over
spreadsheets. However, applications developed in these tools have high error
risk, and no best practices exist. We recommend that advanced, highly
mathematical applications incorporate these tools with spreadsheets into hybrid
applications, where developers can apply EuSpRIG best practices. Development of
hybrid applications can reduce the potential for errors, shorten development
time, and enable higher level operations. We believe that hybrid applications
are the future and over the course of this paper, we apply and extend
spreadsheet best practices to reduce or prevent risks in hybrid Excel/MatLab
applications.

difficulties, lack of uniform development methodologies, and barriers to easy
comprehension of the underlying business models they represent. This paper
presents a case that most of these difficulties stem from the fact that the
standard spreadsheet user-interaction paradigm - the 'cell-matrix' approach -
is appropriate for spreadsheet data presentation but has significant drawbacks
with respect to spreadsheet creation, maintenance and comprehension when
workbooks pass a minimal threshold of complexity. An alternative paradigm for
the automated generation of spreadsheets directly from plain-language business
model descriptions is presented along with its potential benefits. Sunsight
Modeller (TM), a working software system implementing the suggested paradigm,
is briefly described.

for mitigating the \textit{rate anomaly} problem of multirate IEEE 802.11
Wireless LANs employing the mandatory Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)
option. Compared to the widely adopted assumption of saturated network, the
proposed criterion can be applied to general networks whereby the contending
stations are characterized by specific packet arrival rates, $\lambda_s$, and
transmission rates $R_d^{s}$.
  The throughput allocation resulting from the proposed algorithm is able to
greatly increase the aggregate throughput of the DCF while ensuring fairness
levels among the stations of the same order of the ones available with the
classical PF criterion. Put simply, each station is allocated a throughput that
depends on a suitable normalization of its packet rate, which, to some extent,
measures the frequency by which the station tries to gain access to the
channel. Simulation results are presented for some sample scenarios, confirming
the effectiveness of the proposed criterion.

programs (usually called stylesheets or logicsheets). XSLT is a general
purpose, document-oriented functional language, generally used to transform XML
documents (or, in general, solve any problem that can be coded as an XML
document). The proposed solution uses a tree representation for the stylesheets
as well as diverse specific operators in order to obtain, in the studied cases
and a reasonable time, a XSLT stylesheet that performs the transformation.
Several types of representation have been compared, resulting in different
performance and degree of success.

  Practical Approach</title><categories>cs.NI</categories><proxy>ccsd inria-00263813</proxy><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Recent literature has proved that stable dynamic routing algorithms have
solid theoretical foundation that makes them suitable to be implemented in a
real protocol, and used in practice in many different operational network
contexts. Such algorithms inherit much of the properties of congestion
controllers implementing one of the possible combination of AQM/ECN schemes at
nodes and flow control at sources. In this paper we propose a linear program
formulation of the multi-commodity flow problem with congestion control, under
max-min fairness, comprising demands with or without exogenous peak rates. Our
evaluations of the gain, using path diversity, in scenarios as intra-domain
traffic engineering and wireless mesh networks encourages real implementations,
especially in presence of hot spots demands and non uniform traffic matrices.
We propose a flow aware perspective of the subject by using a natural
multi-path extension to current congestion controllers and show its performance
with respect to current proposals. Since flow aware architectures exploiting
path diversity are feasible, scalable, robust and nearly optimal in presence of
flows with exogenous peak rates, we claim that our solution rethinked in the
context of realistic traffic assumptions performs as better as an optimal
approach with all the additional benefits of the flow aware paradigm.

the resampling and requantization processes applied to band-limited Gaussian
signals with flat power spectrum, available through their digitized samples, is
presented. The analysis provides an efficient algorithm for computing the
complete {joint} bivariate discrete probability distribution associated to the
true quantized version of the Gaussian signal and to the quantity estimated
after resampling and requantization of the input digitized sequence. The use of
Fourier transform techniques allows deriving {approximate} analytical
expressions for the quantities of interest, as well as implementing their
efficient computation. Numerical experiments are found to be in good agreement
with the theoretical results, and confirm the validity of the whole approach.

machine word. Modular addition is performed by addition and possibly
subtraction of a word containing several times the modulo. Modular
Multiplication is not directly accessible but modular dot product can be
performed by an integer multiplication by the reverse integer. Modular
multiplication by a word containing a single residue is a also possible.
Therefore matrix multiplication can be performed on such a compressed storage.
We here give bounds on the sizes of primes and matrices for which such a
compression is possible. We also explicit the details of the required
compressed arithmetic routines.

simulation output performance measure, using the Sequential Sampling method
while applying minimum simulation replications, for a class of JIT (Just in
Time) warehousing system called crossdocking. We initially used the Sequential
Sampling method to attain a desired 95% confidence interval half width of
plus/minus 0.5 for our chosen performance measure (Total usage cost, given the
mean maximum level of 157,000 pounds and a mean minimum level of 149,000
pounds). From our results, we achieved a 95% confidence interval half width of
plus/minus 2.8 for our chosen performance measure (Total usage cost, with an
average mean value of 115,000 pounds). However, the Sequential Sampling method
requires a huge number of simulation replications to reduce variance for our
simulation output value to the target level. Arena (version 11) simulation
software was used to conduct this study.

for imperfectly-known fading relay channels are studied. It is assumed that
communication starts with the network training phase in which the receivers
estimate the fading coefficients of their respective channels. In the data
transmission phase, amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying schemes
with different degrees of cooperation are considered, and the corresponding
achievable rate expressions are obtained. Three resource allocation problems
are addressed: 1) power allocation between data and training symbols; 2)
time/bandwidth allocation to the relay; 3) power allocation between the source
and relay in the presence of total power constraints. The achievable rate
expressions are employed to identify the optimal resource allocation
strategies. Finally, energy efficiency is investigated by studying the bit
energy requirements in the low-SNR regime.

for driver scheduling problems. It improves the original Squeaky Wheel
Optimisations effectiveness and execution speed by incorporating two additional
steps of Selection and Mutation which implement evolution within a single
solution. In the ISWO, a cycle of
Analysis-Selection-Mutation-Prioritization-Construction continues until
stopping conditions are reached. The Analysis step first computes the fitness
of a current solution to identify troublesome components. The Selection step
then discards these troublesome components probabilistically by using the
fitness measure, and the Mutation step follows to further discard a small
number of components at random. After the above steps, an input solution
becomes partial and thus the resulting partial solution needs to be repaired.
The repair is carried out by using the Prioritization step to first produce
priorities that determine an order by which the following Construction step
then schedules the remaining components. Therefore, the optimisation in the
ISWO is achieved by solution disruption, iterative improvement and an iterative
constructive repair process performed. Encouraging experimental results are
reported.

presented for personnel scheduling based on choosing a suitable scheduling rule
from a set for each persons assignment. Unlike our previous work of using
genetic algorithms whose learning is implicit, the learning in both approaches
is explicit, i.e. we are able to identify building blocks directly. To achieve
this target, the Bayesian optimization algorithm builds a Bayesian network of
the joint probability distribution of the rules used to construct solutions,
while the adapted classifier system assigns each rule a strength value that is
constantly updated according to its usefulness in the current situation.
Computational results from 52 real data instances of nurse scheduling
demonstrate the success of both approaches. It is also suggested that the
learning mechanism in the proposed approaches might be suitable for other
scheduling problems.

based on the latest immunological theories. The central challenge with computer
security is determining the difference between normal and potentially harmful
activity. For half a century, developers have protected their systems by coding
rules that identify and block specific events. However, the nature of current
and future threats in conjunction with ever larger IT systems urgently requires
the development of automated and adaptive defensive tools. A promising solution
is emerging in the form of Artificial Immune Systems. The Human Immune System
can detect and defend against harmful and previously unseen invaders, so can we
not build a similar Intrusion Detection System for our computers.

a relevant alignment of several sequences is much more challenging than just
optimizing some improbable evaluation functions. Our approach for addressing
multiple sequence alignment focuses on the building of structures in a new
graph model: the factor graph model. This model relies on block-based
formulation of the original problem, formulation that seems to be one of the
most suitable ways for capturing evolutionary aspects of alignment. The
structures are implicitly built by a colony of ants laying down pheromones in
the factor graphs, according to relations between blocks belonging to the
different sequences.

  Satellite Conference within the 4th European Conference on Complex Systems
  (ECCS'2007), Dresden : Allemagne (2007)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The notion of complex systems is common to many domains, from Biology to
Economy, Computer Science, Physics, etc. Often, these systems are made of sets
of entities moving in an evolving environment. One of their major
characteristics is the emergence of some global properties stemmed from local
interactions between the entities themselves and between the entities and the
environment. The structure of these systems as sets of interacting entities
leads researchers to model them as graphs. However, their understanding
requires most often to consider the dynamics of their evolution. It is indeed
not relevant to study some properties out of any temporal consideration. Thus,
dynamic graphs seem to be a very suitable model for investigating the emergence
and the conservation of some properties. GraphStream is a Java-based library
whose main purpose is to help researchers and developers in their daily tasks
of dynamic problem modeling and of classical graph management tasks: creation,
processing, display, etc. It may also be used, and is indeed already used, for
teaching purpose. GraphStream relies on an event-based engine allowing several
event sources. Events may be included in the core of the application, read from
a file or received from an event handler.

allows solving the discrete logarithm problem efficiently if the group order is
known and has no large prime factors. The consequence is that such groups are
avoided. In the past, there have been proposals for cryptography based on
cyclic infrastructures. We will show that the Pohlig-Hellman method can be
adapted to certain cyclic infrastructures, which similarly implies that certain
infrastructures should not be used for cryptography. This generalizes a result
by M\&quot;uller, Vanstone and Zuccherato for infrastructures obtained from
hyperelliptic function fields.
  We recall the Pohlig-Hellman method, define the concept of a cyclic
infrastructure and briefly describe how to obtain such infrastructures from
certain function fields of unit rank one. Then, we describe how to obtain
cyclic groups from discrete cyclic infrastructures and how to apply the
Pohlig-Hellman method to compute absolute distances, which is in general a
computationally hard problem for cyclic infrastructures. Moreover, we give an
algorithm which allows to test whether an infrastructure satisfies certain
requirements needed for applying the Pohlig-Hellman method, and discuss whether
the Pohlig-Hellman method is applicable in infrastructures obtained from number
fields. Finally, we discuss how this influences cryptography based on cyclic
infrastructures.

interest in many application areas, including telecommunications, web
applications and TCP flow modelling. Under the DPS policy the job priority is
controlled by the vector of weights. Verifying the vector of weights it is
possible to modify the service rates of the jobs and optimize system
characteristics. In the present paper we present the results concerning the
comparison of two DPS policies with different weight vectors. We show the
monotonicity of the expected sojourn time of the system depending on the weight
vector under certain condition on the system. Namely, the system has to consist
of classes with means which are quite different from each other. The classes
with similar means can be organized together and considered as one class, so
the given restriction can be overcame.

runs in polylogarithmic number of rounds in the size of the network and
constructs a linear size, lightweight, (1+\epsilon)-spanner for any given
\epsilon &gt; 0. A wireless network is modeled by a d-dimensional \alpha-quasi
unit ball graph (\alpha-UBG), which is a higher dimensional generalization of
the standard unit disk graph (UDG) model. The d-dimensional \alpha-UBG model
goes beyond the unrealistic ``flat world'' assumption of UDGs and also takes
into account transmission errors, fading signal strength, and physical
obstructions. The main result in the paper is this: for any fixed \epsilon &gt; 0,
0 &lt; \alpha \le 1, and d \ge 2, there is a distributed algorithm running in
O(\log n \log^* n) communication rounds on an n-node, d-dimensional \alpha-UBG
G that computes a (1+\epsilon)-spanner G' of G with maximum degree \Delta(G') =
O(1) and total weight w(G') = O(w(MST(G)). This result is motivated by the
topology control problem in wireless ad-hoc networks and improves on existing
topology control algorithms along several dimensions. The technical
contributions of the paper include a new, sequential, greedy algorithm with
relaxed edge ordering and lazy updating, and clustering techniques for
filtering out unnecessary edges.

queries on a static database. Application scenarios of probabilistic databases
however often involve the conditioning of a database using additional
information in the form of new evidence. The conditioning problem is thus to
transform a probabilistic database of priors into a posterior probabilistic
database which is materialized for subsequent query processing or further
refinement. It turns out that the conditioning problem is closely related to
the problem of computing exact tuple confidence values.
  It is known that exact confidence computation is an NP-hard problem. This has
led researchers to consider approximation techniques for confidence
computation. However, neither conditioning nor exact confidence computation can
be solved using such techniques.
  In this paper we present efficient techniques for both problems. We study
several problem decomposition methods and heuristics that are based on the most
successful search techniques from constraint satisfaction, such as the
Davis-Putnam algorithm. We complement this with a thorough experimental
evaluation of the algorithms proposed. Our experiments show that our exact
algorithms scale well to realistic database sizes and can in some scenarios
compete with the most efficient previous approximation algorithms.

networks. We try to overcome the limitations of standard state of the art
tracking methods based on continuous location tracking, i.e. the high energy
dissipation and communication overhead imposed by the active participation of
sensors in the tracking process and the low scalability, especially in sparse
networks. Instead, our approach uses sensors in a passive way: they just record
and judiciously spread information about observed target presence in their
vicinity; this information is then used by the (powerful) tracking agent to
locate the target by just following the traces left at sensors. Our protocol is
greedy, local, distributed, energy efficient and very successful, in the sense
that (as shown by extensive simulations) the tracking agent manages to quickly
locate and follow the target; also, we achieve good trade-offs between the
energy dissipation and latency.

plane is discretized into an N by N grid. Assuming the number of targets K is
small (i.e., K much less than N^2), then we can transmit a sufficiently

reconstruct the target scene. A theoretical upper bound on the sparsity K is
presented. Numerical simulations verify that even better performance can be
achieved in practice. This novel compressed sensing approach offers great
potential for better resolution over classical radar.

significance to error control in noncoherent random linear network coding. What
the maximal cardinality of any constant-dimension code with finite dimension
and minimum distance is and how to construct the optimal constant-dimension
code (or codes) that achieves the maximal cardinality both remain open research
problems. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to solving these two
problems. We first establish a connection between constant-rank codes and
constant-dimension codes. Via this connection, we show that optimal
constant-dimension codes correspond to optimal constant-rank codes over
matrices with sufficiently many rows. As such, the two aforementioned problems
are equivalent to determining the maximum cardinality of constant-rank codes
and to constructing optimal constant-rank codes, respectively. To this end, we
then derive bounds on the maximum cardinality of a constant-rank code with a
given minimum rank distance, propose explicit constructions of optimal or
asymptotically optimal constant-rank codes, and establish asymptotic bounds on
the maximum rate of a constant-rank code.

market. Its design and implementation details are kept secret by its
manufacturer. This paper studies the architecture of the card and the
communication protocol between card and reader. Then it gives a practical,
low-cost, attack that recovers secret information from the memory of the card.
Due to a weakness in the pseudo-random generator, we are able to recover the
keystream generated by the CRYPTO1 stream cipher. We exploit the malleability
of the stream cipher to read all memory blocks of the first sector of the card.
Moreover, we are able to read any sector of the memory of the card, provided
that we know one memory block within this sector. Finally, and perhaps more
damaging, the same holds for modifying memory blocks.

languages that have been formally presented through recursive rules based on
syntactic structure. Abella utilizes a two-level logic approach to
specification and reasoning. One level is defined by a specification logic
which supports a transparent encoding of structural semantics rules and also
enables their execution. The second level, called the reasoning logic, embeds
the specification logic and allows the development of proofs of properties
about specifications. An important characteristic of both logics is that they
exploit the lambda tree syntax approach to treating binding in object
languages. Amongst other things, Abella has been used to prove normalizability
properties of the lambda calculus, cut admissibility for a sequent calculus and
type uniqueness and subject reduction properties. This paper discusses the
logical foundations of Abella, outlines the style of theorem proving that it
supports and finally describes some of its recent applications.

nervous system, the evolution or the weather, allows the definition of special
abilities and models reusable to solve other problems. For instance, Genetic
Algorithms or Ant Colony Optimizations are inspired from natural CSs to solve
optimization problems. This paper proposes the use of ant-based systems to
solve various problems with a non assessing approach. This means that solutions
to some problem are not evaluated. They appear as resultant structures from the
activity of the system. Problems are modeled with graphs and such structures
are observed directly on these graphs. Problems of Multiple Sequences Alignment
and Natural Language Processing are addressed with this approach.

science at different levels: namely micro, meso and macro levels. We use a
previously introduced asymmetric measure of paradigmatic proximity between
terms that enables us to extract structure from a large publications database.
We apply our set of methods on a case study from the complex systems community
through the mapping of more than 400 complex systems science concepts indexed
from a database as large as several millions of journal papers. We will first
summarize the main properties of our asymmetric proximity measure. Then we show
how salient paradigmatic fields can be embedded into a 2-dimensional
visualization into which the terms are plotted according to their relative
specificity and generality index. This meso-level helps us producing
macroscopic maps of the field of science studied featuring the former
paradigmatic fields.

classical logic operations on quantum data, e.g., reversible arithmetic
circuits. In physical implementations, however, TOFFOLI gates are decomposed
into six CNOT gates and several one-qubit gates. Though this decomposition has
been known for at least 10 years, we provide here the first demonstration of
its CNOT-optimality.
  We study three-qubit circuits which contain less than six CNOT gates and
implement a block-diagonal operator, then show that they implicitly describe
the cosine-sine decomposition of a related operator. Leveraging the canonicity
of such decompositions to limit one-qubit gates appearing in respective
circuits, we prove that the n-qubit analogue of the TOFFOLI requires at least
2n CNOT gates. Additionally, our results offer a complete classification of
three-qubit diagonal operators by their CNOT-cost, which holds even if ancilla
qubits are available.

a large number of nodes arranged as a tree of bounded height, under the
assumption of conditionally independent, identically distributed observations.
We characterize the optimal error exponent under a Neyman-Pearson formulation.
We show that the Type II error probability decays exponentially fast with the
number of nodes, and the optimal error exponent is often the same as that
corresponding to a parallel configuration. We provide sufficient, as well as
necessary, conditions for this to happen. For those networks satisfying the
sufficient conditions, we propose a simple strategy that nearly achieves the
optimal error exponent, and in which all non-leaf nodes need only send 1-bit
messages.

belonging to different objects. It is an essential step in image analysis and
computer vision. This paper compares some segmentation technologies and
attempts to find an automated way to better determine the parameters for image
segmentation, especially the connectivity value of $\lambda$ in
$\lambda$-connected segmentation.
  Based on the theories on the maximum entropy method and Otsu's minimum
variance method, we propose:(1)maximum entropy connectedness determination: a
method that uses maximum entropy to determine the best $\lambda$ value in
$\lambda$-connected segmentation, and (2) minimum variance connectedness
determination: a method that uses the principle of minimum variance to
determine $\lambda$ value. Applying these optimization techniques in real
images, the experimental results have shown great promise in the development of
the new methods. In the end, we extend the above method to more general case in
order to compare it with the famous Mumford-Shah method that uses variational
principle and geometric measure.

untrusted storage. SAFIUS provides strong security guarantees like
confidentiality, integrity, prevention from rollback attacks, and
accountability. SAFIUS also enables read/write sharing of data and provides the
standard UNIX-like interface for applications. To achieve accountability with
good performance, it uses asynchronous signatures; to reduce the space required
for storing these signatures, a novel signature pruning mechanism is used.
SAFIUS has been implemented on a GNU/Linux based system modifying OpenGFS.
Preliminary performance studies show that SAFIUS has a tolerable overhead for
providing secure storage: while it has an overhead of about 50% of OpenGFS in
data intensive workloads (due to the overhead of performing
encryption/decryption in software), it is comparable (or better in some cases)
to OpenGFS in metadata intensive workloads.

efficient implementation of computer programs optimized over multiple levels of
the processor/memory and network hierarchy. Using a common formalism to
describe the problem and the partitioning of data over processors and memory
levels allows one to mathematically prove the efficiency and correctness of a
given algorithm as measured in terms of a set of metrics (such as
processor/network speeds, etc.). The approach allows the average programmer to
achieve high-level optimizations similar to those used by compiler writers
(e.g. the notion of &quot;tiling&quot;).
  The approach presented in this monograph makes use of A Mathematics of Arrays
(MoA, Mullin 1988) and an indexing calculus (i.e. the psi-calculus) to enable
the programmer to develop algorithms using high-level compiler-like
optimizations through the ability to algebraically compose and reduce sequences
of array operations. Extensive discussion and benchmark results are presented
for the Fast Fourier Transform and other important algorithms.

compressible with respect to an orthonormal basis. The major algorithmic
challenge in compressive sampling is to approximate a compressible signal from
noisy samples. This paper describes a new iterative recovery algorithm called
CoSaMP that delivers the same guarantees as the best optimization-based
approaches. Moreover, this algorithm offers rigorous bounds on computational
cost and storage. It is likely to be extremely efficient for practical problems
because it requires only matrix-vector multiplies with the sampling matrix. For
many cases of interest, the running time is just O(N*log^2(N)), where N is the
length of the signal.

  H_k and covariance matrix Z_k, slightly modified conclusion</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We present a general rate duality between the multiple access channel (MAC)
and the broadcast channel (BC) which is applicable to systems with and without
nonlinear interference cancellation. Different to the state-of-the-art rate
duality with interference subtraction from Vishwanath et al., the proposed
duality is filter-based instead of covariance-based and exploits the arising
unitary degree of freedom to decorrelate every point-to-point link. Therefore,
it allows for noncooperative stream-wise decoding which reduces complexity and
latency. Moreover, the conversion from one domain to the other does not exhibit
any dependencies during its computation making it accessible to a parallel
implementation instead of a serial one. We additionally derive a rate duality
for systems with multi-antenna terminals when linear filtering without
interference (pre-)subtraction is applied and the different streams of a single
user are not treated as self-interference. Both dualities are based on a
framework already applied to a mean-square-error duality between the MAC and
the BC. Thanks to this novel rate duality, any rate-based optimization with
linear filtering in the BC can now be handled in the dual MAC where the arising
expressions lead to more efficient algorithmic solutions than in the BC due to
the alignment of the channel and precoder indices.

  collaborations welcomed</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this article we investigate the topological changes undergone by
trajectory networks as a consequence of progressive geographical infiltration.
Trajectory networks, a type of knitted network, are obtained by establishing
paths between geographically distributed nodes while following an associated
vector field. For instance, the nodes could correspond to neurons along the
cortical surface and the vector field could correspond to the gradient of
neurotrophic factors, or the nodes could represent towns while the vector
fields would be given by economical and/or geographical gradients. Therefore
trajectory networks are natural models of a large number of geographical
structures. The geographical infiltrations correspond to the addition of new
local connections between nearby existing nodes. As such, these infiltrations
could be related to several real-world processes such as contaminations,
diseases, attacks, parasites, etc. The way in which progressive geographical
infiltrations affect trajectory networks is investigated in terms of the
degree, clustering coefficient, size of the largest component and the lengths
of the existing chains measured along the infiltrations. It is shown that the
maximum infiltration distance plays a critical role in the intensity of the
induced topological changes. For large enough values of this parameter, the
chains intrinsic to the trajectory networks undergo a collapse which is shown
not to be related to the percolation of the network also implied by the
infiltrations.

operational processes including financial reporting, budgeting, forecasting,
and analysis. Microsoft Excel has essentially become a scratch pad and a data
browser that can quickly be put to use for information gathering and
decision-making. However, there is little control in how data comes into Excel,
and how it gets updated. The information supply chain feeding into Excel
remains ad hoc and without any centralized IT control. This paper discusses
some of the pitfalls of the data collection and maintenance process in Excel.
It then suggests service-oriented architecture (SOA) based information
gathering and control techniques to ameliorate the pitfalls of this scratch pad
while improving the integrity of data, boosting the productivity of the
business users, and building controls to satisfy the requirements of Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

over views, our aim being to delimit the boundary between the decidable and the
undecidable fragments of this language. Views currently occupy a central place
in database research, due to their role in applications such as information
integration and data warehousing. Our main result is the identification of a
decidable class of first order queries over unary conjunctive views that
generalises the decidability of the classical class of first order sentences
over unary relations, known as the Lowenheim class. We then demonstrate how
various extensions of this class lead to undecidability and also provide some
expressivity results. Besides its theoretical interest, our new decidable class
is potentially interesting for use in applications such as deciding implication
of complex dependencies, analysis of a restricted class of active database
rules, and ontology reasoning.

in terms of the exponential error bounds. The fundamental difference between
the bit-wise and message-wise unequal error protection (UEP) is demonstrated,
for fixed length block codes on DMCs without feedback. Effect of feedback is
investigated via variable length block codes. It is shown that, feedback
results in a significant improvement in both bit-wise and message-wise UEP
(except the single message case for missed detection). The distinction between
false-alarm and missed-detection formalizations for message-wise UEP is also
considered. All results presented are at rates close to capacity.

lattices with large, non-vanishing determinants (NVD) for four transmit antenna
multiple-input single-output (MISO) space-time (ST) applications. The
constructions are based on the theory of rings of algebraic integers and
related subrings of the Hamiltonian quaternions and can be extended to a larger
number of Tx antennas. The usage of ideals guarantees a non-vanishing
determinant larger than one and an easy way to present the exact proofs for the
minimum determinants. The idea of finding denser sublattices within a given
division algebra is then generalized to a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
case with an arbitrary number of Tx antennas by using the theory of cyclic
division algebras (CDA) and maximal orders. It is also shown that the explicit
constructions in this paper all have a simple decoding method based on sphere
decoding. Related to the decoding complexity, the notion of sensitivity is
introduced, and experimental evidence indicating a connection between
sensitivity, decoding complexity and performance is provided. Simulations in a
quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel show that our dense quaternionic
constructions outperform both the earlier rectangular lattices and the rotated
ABBA lattice as well as the DAST lattice. We also show that our quaternionic
lattice is better than the DAST lattice in terms of the diversity-multiplexing
gain tradeoff.

exploit the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems. Ecosystems are
thought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve
complex, dynamic problems. Self-organisation is perhaps one of the most
desirable features in the systems that we engineer, and it is important for us
to be able to measure self-organising behaviour. We investigate the
self-organising aspects of Digital Ecosystems, created through the application
of evolutionary computing to Multi-Agent Systems (MASs), aiming to determine a
macroscopic variable to characterise the self-organisation of the evolving
agent populations within. We study a measure for the self-organisation called
Physical Complexity; based on statistical physics, automata theory, and
information theory, providing a measure of information relative to the
randomness in an organism's genome, by calculating the entropy in a population.
We investigate an extension to include populations of variable length, and then
built upon this to construct an efficiency measure to investigate clustering
within evolving agent populations. Overall an insight has been achieved into
where and how self-organisation occurs in our Digital Ecosystem, and how it can
be quantified.

cooperative self-organization of Ant Colony Systems to create a naturally
inspired clustering and pattern recognition method. The approach considers each
data item as an ant, which moves inside a grid changing the cells it goes
through, in a fashion similar to Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps. The resulting
algorithm is conceptually more simple, takes less free parameters than other
ant-based clustering algorithms, and, after some parameter tuning, yields very
good results on some benchmark problems.

information-theoretic security to solve one of quantum key distribution's major
security weaknesses: the requirement of an authenticated classical channel to
prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Our scheme employs classical secret sharing
and partially trusted intermediaries to provide arbitrarily high confidence in
the security of the protocol. Although certain failures elude detection, we
discuss preemptive strategies to reduce the probability of failure to an
arbitrarily small level: probability of such failures is exponentially
suppressed with increases in connectivity (i.e., connections per node).

photosensors with Bayer colour filters array is provided in this paper. Using
information from neighbour pixels, it is possible to reconstruct linear images
with wide dynamic range from the oversaturated images. Bayer colour filters
array is considered as an array of neutral filters in a quasimonochromatic
light. If the camera's response function to the desirable light source is known
then one can calculate correction coefficients to reconstruct oversaturated
images. Reconstructed images are linearized in order to provide a linear high
dynamic range images for optical-digital imaging systems. The calibration
procedure for obtaining the camera's response function to the desired light
source is described. Experimental results of the reconstruction of the images
from the oversaturated images are presented for red, green, and blue
quasimonochromatic light sources. Quantitative analysis of the accuracy of the
reconstructed images is provided.

the set of link weights that minimizes a network-wide objective function for a
given intradomain traffic matrix. This approach is inadequate because it
ignores a potential impact on interdomain routing. Indeed, the resulting set of
link weights may trigger BGP to change the BGP next hop for some destination
prefixes, to enforce hot-potato routing policies. In turn, this results in
changes in the intradomain traffic matrix that have not been anticipated by the
link weights optimizer, possibly leading to degraded network performance.
  We propose a BGP-aware link weights optimization method that takes these
effects into account, and even turns them into an advantage. This method uses
the interdomain traffic matrix and other available BGP data, to extend the
intradomain topology with external virtual nodes and links, on which all the
well-tuned heuristics of a classical link weights optimizer can be applied. A
key innovative asset of our method is its ability to also optimize the traffic
on the interdomain peering links. We show, using an operational network as a
case study, that our approach does so efficiently at almost no extra
computational cost.

  Networks</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>submitted to IEEE Trans. on Wireless Communications</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We consider a two-hop wireless network where a transmitter communicates with
a receiver via $M$ relays with an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. Recent
works have shown that sophisticated linear processing such as beamforming and
distributed space-time coding (DSTC) at relays enables to improve the AF
performance. However, the relative utility of these strategies depend on the
available channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), which in turn
depends on system parameters such as the speed of the underlying fading channel
and that of training and feedback procedures. Moreover, it is of practical
interest to have a single transmit scheme that handles different CSIT
scenarios. This motivates us to consider a unified approach based on DSTC that
potentially provides diversity gain with statistical CSIT and exploits some
additional side information if available. Under individual power constraints at
the relays, we optimize the amplifier power allocation such that pairwise error
probability conditioned on the available CSIT is minimized. Under perfect CSIT
we propose an on-off gradient algorithm that efficiently finds a set of relays
to switch on. Under partial and statistical CSIT, we propose a simple
waterfilling algorithm that yields a non-trivial solution between maximum power
allocation and a generalized STC that equalizes the averaged amplified noise
for all relays. Moreover, we derive closed-form solutions for M=2 and in
certain asymptotic regimes that enable an easy interpretation of the proposed
algorithms. It is found that an appropriate amplifier power allocation is
mandatory for DSTC to offer sufficient diversity and power gain in a general
network topology.

Communication
requests arrive over time, and the online algorithm accepts or rejects each
request while maintaining the capacity limitations of the network. The
admission control problem has been usually analyzed as a benefit problem, where
the goal is to devise an online algorithm that accepts the maximum number of
requests possible. The problem with this objective function is that even
algorithms with optimal competitive ratios may reject almost all of the
requests, when it would have been possible to reject only a few. This could be
inappropriate for settings in which rejections are intended to be rare events.
  In this paper, we consider preemptive online algorithms whose goal is to
minimize the number of rejected requests. Each request arrives together with
the path it should be routed on. We show an $O(\log^2 (mc))$-competitive
randomized algorithm for the weighted case, where $m$ is the number of edges in
the graph and $c$ is the maximum edge capacity. For the unweighted case, we
give an $O(\log m \log c)$-competitive randomized algorithm. This settles an
open question of Blum, Kalai and Kleinberg raised in \cite{BlKaKl01}. We note
that allowing preemption and handling requests with given paths are essential
for avoiding trivial lower bounds.

this respect, the understanding of a text and moreover on how the actor exactly
behaves is not only a major concern: as human beings try to store a given input
on short-term memory while associating diverse aspects and actors with
incidents, the following approach represents a virtual architecture, where
collocations are concerned and taken as the associative completion of the
actors' acting. Once that collocations are discovered, they become managed in
separated memory blocks broken down by the actors. As for human beings, the
memory blocks refer to associative mind-maps. We then present several priority
functions to represent the actual temporal situation inside a mind-map to
enable the user to reconstruct the recent events from the discovered temporal
results.

small number of non-zero digits (Hamming weight) or with small absolute sum of
digits. The problem of finding representations with minimal weight has been
solved for integer bases, e.g. by the non-adjacent form in base~2. In this
paper, we consider numeration systems with respect to real bases $\beta$ which
are Pisot numbers and prove that the expansions with minimal absolute sum of
digits are recognizable by finite automata. When $\beta$ is the Golden Ratio,
the Tribonacci number or the smallest Pisot number, we determine expansions
with minimal number of digits $\pm1$ and give explicitely the finite automata
recognizing all these expansions. The average weight is lower than for the
non-adjacent form.

phylogenetic trees into phylogenetic networks. These events imply in particular
that there may exist multiple evolutionary paths from a non-extant species to
an extant one, and this multiplicity makes the comparison of phylogenetic
networks much more difficult than the comparison of phylogenetic trees. In
fact, all attempts to define a sound distance measure on the class of all
phylogenetic networks have failed so far. Thus, the only practical solutions
have been either the use of rough estimates of similarity (based on comparison
of the trees embedded in the networks), or narrowing the class of phylogenetic
networks to a certain class where such a distance is known and can be
efficiently computed. The first approach has the problem that one may identify
two networks as equivalent, when they are not; the second one has the drawback
that there may not exist algorithms to reconstruct such networks from
biological sequences.
  We present in this paper a distance measure on the class of tree-sibling time
consistent phylogenetic networks, which generalize tree-child time consistent
phylogenetic networks, and thus also galled-trees. The practical interest of
this distance measure is twofold: it can be computed in polynomial time by
means of simple algorithms, and there also exist polynomial-time algorithms for
reconstructing networks of this class from DNA sequence data.
  The Perl package Bio::PhyloNetwork, included in the BioPerl bundle,
implements many algorithms on phylogenetic networks, including the computation
of the distance presented in this paper.

information-theoretic security to mitigate one of quantum key distribution's
major limitations: the short maximum transmission distance (~200 km) possible
with present day technology. Our scheme uses classical secret sharing
techniques to allow secure transmission over long distances through a network
containing randomly-distributed compromised nodes. The protocol provides
arbitrarily high confidence in the security of the protocol, with modest
scaling of resource costs with improvement of the security parameter. Although
some types of failure are undetectable, users can take preemptive measures to
make the probability of such failures arbitrarily small.

We mathematically investigate the relation between polynomial rank and
probabilistic tournament methods which are (respectively) generalisations of
the popular linear ranking and tournament selection schemes. We show that every
probabilistic tournament is equivalent to a unique polynomial rank scheme. In
fact, we derived explicit operators for translating between these two types of
selection. Of particular importance is that most linear and most practical
quadratic rank schemes are probabilistic tournaments.

When increasing the density of constraints, they display a broad &quot;clustered&quot;
phase in which the space of solutions is divided into many isolated points.
While the phase diagram can be found easily, these problems, in their clustered
phase, are extremely hard from the algorithmic point of view: the best known
algorithms all fail to find solutions. We thus propose new benchmarks of really
hard optimization problems and provide insight into the origin of their typical
hardness.

extend this by presenting an automated approach where the genetic algorithm
itself, simultaneously to solving the problem, sets weights to balance the
components out. Subsequently we were able to solve a complex and non-linear
scheduling problem better than with a standard direct genetic algorithm
implementation.

problem. It differs from previous evolutionary approaches first because it is
an indirect algorithm, i.e. the actual solutions are found by an external
decoder function. The genetic algorithm itself provides this decoder with
permutations of the solution variables and other parameters. Second, it will be
shown that results can be further improved by adding another indirect
optimisation layer. The decoder will not directly seek out low cost solutions
but instead aims for good exploitable solutions. These are then post optimised
by another hill-climbing algorithm. Although seemingly more complicated, we
will show that this three-stage approach has advantages in terms of solution
quality, speed and adaptability to new types of problems over more direct
approaches. Extensive computational results are presented and compared to the
latest evolutionary and other heuristic approaches to the same data instances.

algorithm under different partnering strategies. Cascading clusters of
sub-populations are built from the bottom up, with higher-level sub-populations
optimising larger parts of the problem. Hence higher-level sub-populations
potentially search a larger search space with a lower resolution whilst
lower-level sub-populations search a smaller search space with a higher
resolution. The effects of different partner selection schemes amongst the
sub-populations on solution quality are examined for two constrained
optimisation problems. We examine a number of recombination partnering
strategies in the construction of higher-level individuals and a number of
related schemes for evaluating sub-solutions. It is shown that partnering
strategies that exploit problem-specific knowledge are superior and can counter
inappropriate (sub)fitness measurements.

nurse scheduling problem with an integer programming formulation and
evolutionary algorithms. Secondly, to detail a novel statistical method of
comparing and hence building better scheduling algorithms by identifying
successful algorithm modifications. The comparison method captures the results
of algorithms in a single figure that can then be compared using traditional
statistical techniques. Thus, the proposed method of comparing algorithms is an
objective procedure designed to assist in the process of improving an
algorithm. This is achieved even when some results are non-numeric or missing
due to infeasibility. The final algorithm outperforms all previous evolutionary
algorithms, which relied on human expertise for modification.

problem arising at a major UK hospital. Although Genetic Algorithms have been
successfully used for similar problems in the past, they always had to overcome
the limitations of the classical Genetic Algorithms paradigm in handling the
conflict between objectives and constraints. The approach taken here is to use
an indirect coding based on permutations of the nurses, and a heuristic decoder
that builds schedules from these permutations. Computational experiments based
on 52 weeks of live data are used to evaluate three different decoders with
varying levels of intelligence, and four well-known crossover operators.
Results are further enhanced by introducing a hybrid crossover operator and by
making use of simple bounds to reduce the size of the solution space. The
results reveal that the proposed algorithm is able to find high quality
solutions and is both faster and more flexible than a recently published Tabu
Search approach.

adaptive and self-organising nature. This paper presents an Artificial Immune
System (AIS) that exploits some of these characteristics and is applied to the
task of film recommendation by Collaborative Filtering (CF). Natural evolution
and in particular the immune system have not been designed for classical
optimisation. However, for this problem, we are not interested in finding a
single optimum. Rather we intend to identify a sub-set of good matches on which
recommendations can be based. It is our hypothesis that an AIS built on two
central aspects of the biological immune system will be an ideal candidate to
achieve this: Antigen-antibody interaction for matching and idiotypic
antibody-antibody interaction for diversity. Computational results are
presented in support of this conjecture and compared to those found by other CF
techniques.

computer systems and networks, and are becoming more and more necessary as
reliance on Internet services increases and systems with sensitive data are
more commonly open to Internet access. An ids responsibility is to detect
suspicious or unacceptable system and network activity and to alert a systems
administrator to this activity. The majority of ids use a set of signatures
that define what suspicious traffic is, and Snort is one popular and actively
developing open-source ids that uses such a set of signatures known as Snort
rules. Our aim is to identify a way in which Snort could be developed further
by generalising rules to identify novel attacks. In particular, we attempted to
relax and vary the conditions and parameters of current Snort rules, using a
similar approach to classic rule learning operators such as generalisation and
specialisation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
experiments with standard datasets and show that we are able to detect
previously undeleted variants of various attacks. We conclude by discussing the
general effectiveness and appropriateness of generalisation in Snort based ids
rule processing.

of rules that involve domain knowledge. This paper presents an Estimation of
Distribution Algorithm (eda) for the nurse scheduling problem, which involves
choosing a suitable scheduling rule from a set for the assignment of each
nurse. Unlike previous work that used Genetic Algorithms (ga) to implement
implicit learning, the learning in the proposed algorithm is explicit, i.e. we
identify and mix building blocks directly. The eda is applied to implement such
explicit learning by building a Bayesian network of the joint distribution of
solutions. The conditional probability of each variable in the network is
computed according to an initial set of promising solutions. Subsequently, each
new instance for each variable is generated by using the corresponding
conditional probabilities, until all variables have been generated, i.e. in our
case, a new rule string has been obtained. Another set of rule strings will be
generated in this way, some of which will replace previous strings based on
fitness selection. If stopping conditions are not met, the conditional
probabilities for all nodes in the Bayesian network are updated again using the
current set of promising rule strings. Computational results from 52 real data
instances demonstrate the success of this approach. It is also suggested that
the learning mechanism in the proposed approach might be suitable for other
scheduling problems.

inter-antibody stimulation and suppression as well as matching to antigens. The
theory has proved the most popular Artificial Immune System (ais) model for
incorporation into behavior-based robotics but guidelines for implementing
idiotypic selection are scarce. Furthermore, the direct effects of employing
the technique have not been demonstrated in the form of a comparison with
non-idiotypic systems. This paper aims to address these issues. A method for
integrating an idiotypic ais network with a Reinforcement Learning based
control system (rl) is described and the mechanisms underlying antibody
stimulation and suppression are explained in detail. Some hypotheses that
account for the network advantage are put forward and tested using three
systems with increasing idiotypic complexity. The basic rl, a simplified hybrid
ais-rl that implements idiotypic selection independently of derived
concentration levels and a full hybrid ais-rl scheme are examined. The test bed
takes the form of a simulated Pioneer robot that is required to navigate
through maze worlds detecting and tracking door markers.

and performance of a company. However, research findings are mixed. This paper
provides a multi-disciplinary review of the current evidence of such a
relationship and offers suggestions for further exploration. We provide an
extensive review of the literature in terms of research findings from studies
that have been trying to measure and understand the impact that individual
management practices and clusters of management practices have on productivity
at different levels of analysis. We focus our review on Operations Management
(om) and Human Resource Management (hrm) practices as well as joint
applications of these practices. In conclusion, we can say that taken as a
whole, the research findings are equivocal. Some studies have found a positive
relationship between the adoption of management practices and productivity,
some negative and some no association whatsoever. We believe that the lack of
universal consensus on the effect of the adoption of complementary management
practices might be driven either by measurement issues or by the level of
analysis. Consequently, there is a need for further research. In particular,
for a multi-level approach from the lowest possible level of aggregation up to
the firm-level of analysis in order to assess the impact of management
practices upon the productivity of firms.

  Part</title><categories>cs.SC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We have designed a new symbolic-numeric strategy to compute efficiently and
accurately floating point Puiseux series defined by a bivariate polynomial over
an algebraic number field. In essence, computations modulo a well chosen prime
$p$ are used to obtain the exact information required to guide floating point
computations. In this paper, we detail the symbolic part of our algorithm:
First of all, we study modular reduction of Puiseux series and give a good
reduction criterion to ensure that the information required by the numerical
part is preserved. To establish our results, we introduce a simple modification
of classical Newton polygons, that we call &quot;generic Newton polygons&quot;, which
happen to be very convenient. Then, we estimate the arithmetic complexity of
computing Puiseux series over finite fields and improve known bounds. Finally,
we give bit-complexity bounds for deterministic and randomized versions of the
symbolic part. The details of the numerical part will be described in a
forthcoming paper.

The goal of this
work is to introduce a common formalized framework for current research in this
area and to eliminate shortcomings of existing models of concurrency. Following
up the previous research of the authors and other researchers on concurrency,
here we build a high-level metamodel EAP (event-action-process) for concurrent
processes. This metamodel comprises a variety of other models of concurrent
processes. We shape mathematical models for, and study events, actions, and
processes in relation to important practical problems, such as communication in
networks, concurrent programming, and distributed computations. In the third
section of the work, a three-level algebra of events, actions and processes is
constructed and studied as a new stage of algebra for concurrent processes.
Relations between EAP process algebra and other models of concurrency are
considered in the fourth section of this work.

half-duplex multiple-antenna relays assist in the transmission between
a/several multiple-antenna transmitter(s) and a multiple-antenna receiver. Each
two nodes are assumed to be either connected through a quasi-static Rayleigh
fading channel, or disconnected. We propose a new scheme, which we call
\textit{random sequential} (RS), based on the amplify-and-forward relaying. We
prove that for general multiple-antenna multiple-relay networks, the proposed
scheme achieves the maximum diversity gain. Furthermore, we derive
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the proposed RS scheme for general
single-antenna multiple-relay networks. It is shown that for single-antenna
two-hop multiple-access multiple-relay ($K&gt;1$) networks (without direct link
between the transmitter(s) and the receiver), the proposed RS scheme achieves
the optimum DMT. However, for the case of multiple access single relay setup,
we show that the RS scheme reduces to the naive amplify-and-forward relaying
and is not optimum in terms of DMT, while the dynamic decode-and-forward scheme
is shown to be optimum for this scenario.

databases. For this method, support, the co-occurrence frequency of the items
which form an association, is used as the primary indicator of the
associations's significance. A single user-specified support threshold is used
to decided if associations should be further investigated. Support has some
known problems with rare items, favors shorter itemsets and sometimes produces
misleading associations.
  In this paper we develop a novel model-based frequency constraint as an
alternative to a single, user-specified minimum support. The constraint
utilizes knowledge of the process generating transaction data by applying a
simple stochastic mixture model (the NB model) which allows for transaction
data's typically highly skewed item frequency distribution. A user-specified
precision threshold is used together with the model to find local frequency
thresholds for groups of itemsets. Based on the constraint we develop the
notion of NB-frequent itemsets and adapt a mining algorithm to find all
NB-frequent itemsets in a database. In experiments with publicly available
transaction databases we show that the new constraint provides improvements
over a single minimum support threshold and that the precision threshold is
more robust and easier to set and interpret by the user.

multi-level integrity. We observe that in this model, trusted code can be
blamed for any information-flow attack; thus, it is possible to eliminate such
attacks by static analysis of trusted code. We formalize this model by
designing a type system that can efficiently enforce data-flow integrity on
Windows Vista. Typechecking guarantees that objects whose contents are
statically trusted never contain untrusted values, regardless of what untrusted
code runs in the environment. Some of Windows Vista's runtime access checks are
necessary for soundness; others are redundant and can be optimized away.

internal control. The case of failed Jamaican commercial banks demonstrates how
poor archiving can lead to weaknesses in spreadsheet control that contribute to
operational risk. In addition, the Sarbanes-0xley Act contains a number of
provisions that require tighter control over the archiving of spreadsheets. To
mitigate operational risks and achieve compliance with the records-related
provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, the author argues that organisations should
introduce records management programmes that provide control over the archiving
of spreadsheets. At a minimum, spreadsheet archiving controls should identify
and ensure compliance with retention requirements, support document production
in the event of regulatory inquiries or litigation, and prevent unauthorised
destruction of records.

finite capacity of a buffer and the packet-dropping procedure give rise to
specific boundary conditions which lead to strong loss rate fluctuations at the
critical point even in the absence of such fluctuations in the data arrival

Storage Area Networks (SANs) are deployed as a means to scale enterprise
storage. SANs based on Fibre Channel have been used extensively in the last
decade while iSCSI is fast becoming a serious contender due to its reduced
costs and unified infrastructure. This work examines the performance of iSCSI
with multiple TCP connections. Multiple TCP connections are often used to
realize higher bandwidth but there may be no fairness in how bandwidth is
distributed. We propose a mechanism to share congestion information across
multiple flows in ``Fair-TCP'' for improved performance. Our results show that
Fair-TCP significantly improves the performance for I/O intensive workloads.

Ordentlich and Weissman [In Proceedings of IEEE Information Theory Workshop
(2004) 117--122], we derive an asymptotic formula (when the noise parameter is
small) for the entropy rate of a hidden Markov chain, observed when a Markov
chain passes through a BSC. Using this result, we establish an asymptotic
formula for the capacity of a BSC with input process supported on an
irreducible finite type constraint, as the noise parameter tends to zero.

networked organization. Covert nodes refer to the nodes which are not
observable directly. They affect social interactions, but do not appear in the
surveillance logs which record the participants of the social interactions.
Discovering the covert nodes is defined as identifying the suspicious logs
where the covert nodes would appear if the covert nodes became overt. A
mathematical model is developed for the maximal likelihood estimation of the
network behind the social interactions and for the identification of the
suspicious logs. Precision, recall, and F measure characteristics are
demonstrated with the dataset generated from a real organization and the
computationally synthesized datasets. The performance is close to the
theoretical limit for any covert nodes in the networks of any topologies and
sizes if the ratio of the number of observation to the number of possible
communication patterns is large.

visibility of defects and disciplined development. If risk to the enterprise is
to be reduced, individuals need to become aware of the reality of the quality

Software Quality Management measurements of defect density and removal
efficiency are applicable. Research of actual spreadsheet error rates shows
data consistent with other software depending on the extent to which the work
product was reviewed before inspection. The paper argues that the payback for
an investment in early review time is justified by the saving in project delay
and expensive errors in use.

consisting of a number of well distinguished interconnected
parts--``communities'' or modules. We develop an analytical approach allowing
us to obtain the statistics of connected components and an intervertex distance
distribution in these modular networks, and to describe their global
organization and structure. In particular, we study the evolution of the
intervertex distance distribution with an increasing number of interlinks
connecting two infinitely large uncorrelated networks. We demonstrate that even
a relatively small number of shortcuts unite the networks into one. In more
precise terms, if the number of the interlinks is any finite fraction of the
total number of connections, then the intervertex distance distribution
approaches a delta-function peaked form, and so the network is united.

wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for achieving effective transmission and hence
better power conservation. Common security protocols for aggregated WSNs are
either hop-by-hop or end-to-end, each of which has its own encryption schemes
considering different security primitives. End-to-end encrypted data
aggregation protocols introduce maximum data secrecy with in-efficient data
aggregation and more vulnerability to active attacks, while hop-by-hop data
aggregation protocols introduce maximum data integrity with efficient data
aggregation and more vulnerability to passive attacks.
  In this paper, we propose a secure aggregation protocol for aggregated WSNs
deployed in hostile environments in which dual attack modes are present. Our
proposed protocol is a blend of flexible data aggregation as in hop-by-hop
protocols and optimal data confidentiality as in end-to-end protocols. Our
protocol introduces an efficient O(1) heuristic for checking data integrity
along with cost-effective heuristic-based divide and conquer attestation
process which is $O(\ln{n})$ in average -O(n) in the worst scenario- for
further verification of aggregated results.

deploy security features and protocols is a challenge, in particular because of
economic reasons arising from the presence of network externalities. Our goal
in this paper is to carefully model and quantify the impact of such
externalities on the investment in, and deployment of, security features and
protocols in a network.
  Specifically, we study a network of interconnected agents, which are subject
to epidemic risks such as those caused by propagating viruses and worms, and
which can decide whether or not to invest some amount to self-protect and
deploy security solutions. We make three contributions in the paper. First, we
introduce a general model which combines an epidemic propagation model with an
economic model for agents which captures network effects and externalities.
Second, borrowing ideas and techniques used in statistical physics, we
introduce a Local Mean Field (LMF) model, which extends the standard mean-field
approximation to take into account the correlation structure on local
neighborhoods. Third, we solve the LMF model in a network with externalities,
and we derive analytic solutions for sparse random graphs, for which we obtain
asymptotic results. We explicitly identify the impact of network externalities
on the decision to invest in and deploy security features. In other words, we
identify both the economic and network properties that determine the adoption
of security technologies.

recently, because this research area have been used with success in the
development of new efficient quantum algorithms. A general simulator of quantum
walks is very important for the development of this area, since it allows the
researchers to focus on the mathematical and physical aspects of the research
instead of deviating the efforts to the implementation of specific numerical
simulations. In this paper we present QWalk, a quantum walk simulator for one-
and two-dimensional lattices. Finite two-dimensional lattices with generic
topologies can be used. Decoherence can be simulated by performing measurements
or by breaking links of the lattice. We use examples to explain the usage of
the software and to show some recent results of the literature that are easily
reproduced by the simulator.

other users display long-tailed distributions in many aspects of behavior.
Using behavior on one such community site, Essembly, we propose and evaluate
plausible mechanisms to explain these behaviors. Unlike purely descriptive
models, these mechanisms rely on user behaviors based on information available
locally to each user. For Essembly, we find the long-tails arise from large
differences among user activity rates and qualities of the rated content, as
well as the extensive variability in the time users devote to the site. We show
that the models not only explain overall behavior but also allow estimating the
quality of content from their early behaviors.

precisely equivalent to a new robust optimization formulation. We show that
this equivalence of robust optimization and regularization has implications for
both algorithms, and analysis. In terms of algorithms, the equivalence suggests
more general SVM-like algorithms for classification that explicitly build in
protection to noise, and at the same time control overfitting. On the analysis
front, the equivalence of robustness and regularization, provides a robust
optimization interpretation for the success of regularized SVMs. We use the
this new robustness interpretation of SVMs to give a new proof of consistency
of (kernelized) SVMs, thus establishing robustness as the reason regularized
SVMs generalize well.

react swiftly and efficiently. In this prospect, we present in this paper a
decision support system that aims to prepare actors in a crisis situation
thanks to a decision-making support. The global architecture of this system is
presented in the first part. Then we focus on a part of this system which is
designed to represent the information of the current situation. This part is
composed of a multiagent system that is made of factual agents. Each agent
carries a semantic feature and aims to represent a partial part of a situation.
The agents develop thanks to their interactions by comparing their semantic
features using proximity measures and according to specific ontologies.

run time has been achieved by using heuristic priorities on the choice of the

is rather simple, though they have a significant effect on the run time. The
analysis is done using a tailored non-standard measure.

of reinforcement learning. It is shown that by learning the value-gradients
exploration or stochastic behaviour is no longer needed to find locally optimal
trajectories. This is the main motivation for using value-gradients, and it is
argued that learning value-gradients is the actual objective of any
value-function learning algorithm for control problems. It is also argued that
learning value-gradients is significantly more efficient than learning just the
values, and this argument is supported in experiments by efficiency gains of
several orders of magnitude, in several problem domains. Once value-gradients
are introduced into learning, several analyses become possible. For example, a
surprising equivalence between a value-gradient learning algorithm and a
policy-gradient learning algorithm is proven, and this provides a robust
convergence proof for control problems using a value function with a general
function approximator.

its behavior when communication systems are combined. Our framework includes a
variety of discrete, continuous, and, conjecturally, quantum information
measures. It also includes some familiar mathematical constructs not normally
associated with information, such as vector space dimension. We discuss these
examples and prove basic results from the axioms.

  Systems (MASS 2005), Washington, DC, November, 2005</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Geometric routing algorithms like GFG (GPSR) are lightweight, scalable
algorithms that can be used to route in resource-constrained ad hoc wireless
networks. However, such algorithms run on planar graphs only. To efficiently
construct a planar graph, they require a unit-disk graph. To make the topology
unit-disk, the maximum link length in the network has to be selected
conservatively. In practical setting this leads to the designs where the node
density is rather high. Moreover, the network diameter of a planar subgraph is
greater than the original graph, which leads to longer routes. To remedy this
problem, we propose a void traversal algorithm that works on arbitrary
geometric graphs. We describe how to use this algorithm for geometric routing
with guaranteed delivery and compare its performance with GFG.

separating two subgraphs that are internally well connected.
  While there has been a large body of work devoted to algorithms for
distributed averaging, nearly all algorithms involve only {\it convex} updates.
In this paper, we suggest that {\it non-convex} updates can lead to significant
improvements. We do so by exhibiting a decentralized algorithm for graphs with
one sparse cut that uses non-convex averages and has an averaging time that can
be significantly smaller than the averaging time of known distributed
algorithms, such as those of \cite{tsitsiklis, Boyd}. We use stochastic
dominance to prove this result in a way that may be of independent interest.

two-user discrete memoryless (DM) multiple-access channel (MAC) is derived.
This is the first bound of this type that explicitly imposes independence of
the users' input distributions (conditioned on the time-sharing auxiliary
variable) and thus results in a tighter sphere-packing exponent when compared
to the tightest known exponent derived by Haroutunian.

and satisfying Hamming distance constraints between oligonucleotides and their
Watson-Crick complements is important in reducing hybridization errors in DNA
computing, DNA microarray technologies, and molecular bar coding. Various
techniques have been studied for the construction of such oligonucleotide
libraries, ranging from algorithmic constructions via stochastic local search
to theoretical constructions via coding theory. We introduce a new stochastic
local search method which yields improvements up to more than one third of the
benchmark lower bounds of Gaborit and King (2005) for n-mer oligonucleotide
libraries when n &lt;= 14. We also found several optimal libraries by computing
maximum cliques on certain graphs.

product $R_1\times R_2\times...\times R_k$ where $R_i$(for $1\leq i\leq k$) is
a closed interval of the form $[a_i,a_i+1]$ on the real line. A graph $G$ on
$n$ nodes is said to be representable as the intersection of $k$-cubes (cube
representation in $k$ dimensions) if each vertex of $G$ can be mapped to a
$k$-cube such that two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if their
corresponding $k$-cubes have a non-empty intersection. The \emph{cubicity} of
$G$ denoted as $\cubi(G)$ is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ can be represented
as the intersection of $k$-cubes.
  We give an $O(bw\cdot n)$ algorithm to compute the cube representation of a
general graph $G$ in $bw+1$ dimensions given a bandwidth ordering of the
vertices of $G$, where $bw$ is the \emph{bandwidth} of $G$. As a consequence,
we get $O(\Delta)$ upper bounds on the cubicity of many well-known graph
classes such as AT-free graphs, circular-arc graphs and co-comparability graphs
which have $O(\Delta)$ bandwidth. Thus we have: 1) $\cubi(G)\leq 3\Delta-1$, if
$G$ is an AT-free graph. 2) $\cubi(G)\leq 2\Delta+1$, if $G$ is a circular-arc
graph. 3) $\cubi(G)\leq 2\Delta$, if $G$ is a co-comparability graph. Also for
these graph classes, there are constant factor approximation algorithms for
bandwidth computation that generate orderings of vertices with $O(\Delta)$
width. We can thus generate the cube representation of such graphs in
$O(\Delta)$ dimensions in polynomial time.

Formally, the data structure must store a function f: U -&gt;{0,1}^r that has
specified values on the elements of a given set S, a subset of U, |S|=n, but
may have any value on elements outside S. Minimal perfect hashing makes it
possible to avoid storing the set S, but this induces a space overhead of
Theta(n) bits in addition to the nr bits needed for function values. In this
paper we show how to eliminate this overhead. Moreover, we show that for any k
query time O(k) can be achieved using space that is within a factor 1+e^{-k} of
optimal, asymptotically for large n. If we allow logarithmic evaluation time,
the additive overhead can be reduced to O(log log n) bits whp. The time to
construct the data structure is O(n), expected. A main technical ingredient is
to utilize existing tight bounds on the probability of almost square random
matrices with rows of low weight to have full row rank. In addition to direct
constructions, we point out a close connection between retrieval structures and
hash tables where keys are stored in an array and some kind of probing scheme
is used. Further, we propose a general reduction that transfers the results on
retrieval into analogous results on approximate membership, a problem
traditionally addressed using Bloom filters. Again, we show how to eliminate
the space overhead present in previously known methods, and get arbitrarily
close to the lower bound. The evaluation procedures of our data structures are
extremely simple (similar to a Bloom filter). For the results stated above we
assume free access to fully random hash functions. However, we show how to
justify this assumption using extra space o(n) to simulate full randomness on a
RAM.

intimately connected and complementary path diversity units: simple cycles, and
cycle adjacencies. A recursive network abstraction procedure is presented,
together with an associated generic recursive routing protocol family that
offers many desirable features.

variables has a lot of local minima. One of approaches allowing one to find in

blocks/domains. To minimize the functional one has to change the states of
aggregated variables (domains). In the present publication we discuss methods
of domains formation. It is shown that the best results are obtained when
domains are formed by variables that are strongly connected with each other.

nodes transmit their messages to the relay node. Then the relay node decodes
the messages and broadcasts a re-encoded composition of them in the second
phase. We consider Gaussian MIMO channels and determine the capacity region for
the second phase which we call the Gaussian MIMO bidirectional broadcast
channel.

distance (or minimum &quot;pseudodistance&quot;) for coded modulation systems using
linear codes with $q$-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation over the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. These bounds apply to both binary and
nonbinary coded modulation systems which use direct modulation mapping of coded
symbols. The minimum pseudodistance may serve as a first-order measure of
error-correcting performance for both linear-programming and message-passing
based receivers. In the case of a linear-programming based receiver, the
minimum pseudodistance may be used to form an exact bound on the codeword error
rate of the system.

provide an alternative proof of the APN property of the functions.

behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic transition systems. These
pseudometrics are a quantitative analogue of probabilistic bisimilarity.
Distance zero captures probabilistic bisimilarity. Each pseudometric has a
discount factor, a real number in the interval (0, 1]. The smaller the discount
factor, the more the future is discounted. If the discount factor is one, then
the future is not discounted at all. Desharnais et al. showed that the
behavioural distances can be calculated up to any desired degree of accuracy if
the discount factor is smaller than one. In this paper, we show that the
distances can also be approximated if the future is not discounted. A key
ingredient of our algorithm is Tarski's decision procedure for the first order
theory over real closed fields. By exploiting the Kantorovich-Rubinstein
duality theorem we can restrict to the existential fragment for which more
efficient decision procedures exist.

constructs a disjunctive logic program P, such that the preferred extensions of
AF correspond to the stable models of P, after intersecting each stable model
with the relevant atoms. The given mapping function is of polynomial size
w.r.t. AF. In particular, we identify that there is a direct relationship
between the minimal models of a propositional formula and the preferred
extensions of an argumentation framework by working on representing the
defeated arguments. Then we show how to infer the preferred extensions of an
argumentation framework by using UNSAT algorithms and disjunctive stable model
solvers. The relevance of this result is that we define a direct relationship
between one of the most satisfactory argumentation semantics and one of the
most successful approach of non-monotonic reasoning i.e., logic programming
with the stable model semantics.

the Shannon capacity of interference networks at high SNR. However, the extent
to which interference can be aligned over a finite number of signalling
dimensions remains unknown. Another important concern for interference
alignment schemes is the requirement of global channel knowledge. In this work
we provide examples of iterative algorithms that utilize the reciprocity of
wireless networks to achieve interference alignment with only local channel
knowledge at each node. These algorithms also provide numerical insights into
the feasibility of interference alignment that are not yet available in theory.

accelerate the convergence of evolutionary programming algorithms while still
retaining much of their ability to deal with multi-modal problems. The
strategies, called directional mutation and recorded step in this paper, can
operate independently but together they greatly enhance the ability of
evolutionary programming algorithms to deal with fitness landscapes
characterized by long narrow valleys. The directional mutation aspect of this
combined method uses correlated meta-mutation but does not introduce a full
covariance matrix. These new methods are thus much more economical in terms of
storage for problems with high dimensionality. Additionally, directional
mutation is rotationally invariant which is a substantial advantage over
self-adaptive methods which use a single variance per coordinate for problems
where the natural orientation of the problem is not oriented along the axes.

  Asymptotic Behaviour and Optimal Power Allocation</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>25 pages, 6 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This paper considers state estimation of linear systems using analog amplify
and forwarding with multiple sensors, for both multiple access and orthogonal
access schemes. Optimal state estimation can be achieved at the fusion center
using a time varying Kalman filter. We show that in many situations, the
estimation error covariance decays at a rate of $1/M$ when the number of
sensors $M$ is large. We consider optimal allocation of transmission powers
that 1) minimizes the sum power usage subject to an error covariance constraint
and 2) minimizes the error covariance subject to a sum power constraint. In the
case of fading channels with channel state information the optimization
problems are solved using a greedy approach, while for fading channels without
channel state information but with channel statistics available a sub-optimal
linear estimator is derived.

  Covertexts and Gaussian Attacks</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>20 pages, 7 Postscript figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The problem of optimum watermark embedding and detection was addressed in a
recent paper by Merhav and Sabbag, where the optimality criterion was the
maximum false-negative error exponent subject to a guaranteed false-positive
error exponent. In particular, Merhav and Sabbag derived universal
asymptotically optimum embedding and detection rules under the assumption that
the detector relies solely on second order joint empirical statistics of the
received signal and the watermark. In the case of a Gaussian host signal and a
Gaussian attack, however, closed-form expressions for the optimum embedding
strategy and the false-negative error exponent were not obtained in that work.
In this paper, we derive such expressions, again, under the universality
assumption that neither the host variance nor the attack power are known to
either the embedder or the detector. The optimum embedding rule turns out to be
very simple and with an intuitively-appealing geometrical interpretation. The
improvement with respect to existing sub-optimum schemes is demonstrated by
displaying the optimum false-negative error exponent as a function of the
guaranteed false-positive error exponent.

  for Hospital Personnel Scheduling</title><categories>cs.NE cs.CE</categories><journal-ref>Technical Report NOTTCS-TR-2007-4, University of Nottingham, UK,,
  2006</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Nurse rostering is a complex scheduling problem that affects hospital
personnel on a daily basis all over the world. This paper presents a new
component-based approach with adaptive perturbations, for a nurse scheduling
problem arising at a major UK hospital. The main idea behind this technique is
to decompose a schedule into its components (i.e. the allocated shift pattern
of each nurse), and then mimic a natural evolutionary process on these
components to iteratively deliver better schedules. The worthiness of all
components in the schedule has to be continuously demonstrated in order for
them to remain there. This demonstration employs a dynamic evaluation function
which evaluates how well each component contributes towards the final
objective. Two perturbation steps are then applied: the first perturbation
eliminates a number of components that are deemed not worthy to stay in the
current schedule; the second perturbation may also throw out, with a low level
of probability, some worthy components. The eliminated components are
replenished with new ones using a set of constructive heuristics using local
optimality criteria. Computational results using 52 data instances demonstrate
the applicability of the proposed approach in solving real-world problems.

  Technologies, 554-564, 2008</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  When designing systems that are complex, dynamic and stochastic in nature,
simulation is generally recognised as one of the best design support
technologies, and a valuable aid in the strategic and tactical decision making
process. A simulation model consists of a set of rules that define how a system
changes over time, given its current state. Unlike analytical models, a
simulation model is not solved but is run and the changes of system states can
be observed at any point in time. This provides an insight into system dynamics
rather than just predicting the output of a system based on specific inputs.
Simulation is not a decision making tool but a decision support tool, allowing
better informed decisions to be made. Due to the complexity of the real world,
a simulation model can only be an approximation of the target system. The
essence of the art of simulation modelling is abstraction and simplification.
Only those characteristics that are important for the study and analysis of the
target system should be included in the simulation model.

defends the body from foreign pathogens. It is able to categorize all cells (or
molecules) within the body as self-cells or non-self cells. It does this with
the help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action
from a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical
messengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune
system. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and
destroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds
to previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can
remain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information
processing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in
recent years. A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by
immunology, has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts
from the immune have been extracted and applied for solution to real world
science and engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the
immune system metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems
methods. We will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for
Artificial Immune Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one
such problem. A comparison of the Artificial Immune Systems to other well-known
algorithms, areas for future work, tips &amp; tricks and a list of resources will
round this tutorial off. It should be noted that as Artificial Immune Systems
is still a young and evolving field, there is not yet a fixed algorithm
template and hence actual implementations might differ somewhat from time to
time and from those examples given here.

analyze and publish information about statistical databases. It is often
claimed that differential privacy provides guarantees against adversaries with
arbitrary side information. In this paper, we provide a precise formulation of
these guarantees in terms of the inferences drawn by a Bayesian adversary. We
show that this formulation is satisfied by both &quot;vanilla&quot; differential privacy
as well as a relaxation known as (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy. Our
formulation follows the ideas originally due to Dwork and McSherry [Dwork
2006]. This paper is, to our knowledge, the first place such a formulation
appears explicitly. The analysis of the relaxed definition is new to this
paper, and provides some concrete guidance for setting parameters when using
(epsilon,delta)-differential privacy.

zero divisors, such as $Q_0$ and prove a generic completeness result. We apply
this result to cancellation meadows expanded with differentiation operators,
the sign function, and with floor, ceiling and a signed variant of the square
root, respectively. We give an equational axiomatization of these operators and
thus obtain a finite basis for various expanded cancellation meadows.

sharing of scientific information at the CERN (European Center for Nuclear
Research) few could have imagined the role it would come to play in the
following decades. Since then, the increasing ubiquity of Internet access and
the frequency with which people interact with it raise the possibility of using
the Web to better observe, understand, and monitor several aspects of human
social behavior. Web sites with large numbers of frequently returning users are
ideal for this task. If these sites belong to companies or universities, their
usage patterns can furnish information about the working habits of entire
populations. In this work, we analyze the properly anonymized logs detailing
the access history to Emory University's Web site. Emory is a medium size
university located in Atlanta, Georgia. We find interesting structure in the
activity patterns of the domain and study in a systematic way the main forces
behind the dynamics of the traffic. In particular, we show that both linear
preferential linking and priority based queuing are essential ingredients to
understand the way users navigate the Web.

also the substrate on which various interprocedural analyses are performed and
are integral part of program comprehension/testing. Given their universality
and usefulness, it is imperative to ask if call graphs exhibit any intrinsic
graph theoretic features -- across versions, program domains and source
languages. This work is an attempt to answer these questions: we present and
investigate a set of meaningful graph measures that help us understand call
graphs better; we establish how these measures correlate, if any, across
different languages and program domains; we also assess the overall, language
independent software quality by suitably interpreting these measures.

reduction based on extracting the dominant eigenvectors of the sample
covariance matrix. However, PCA is well known to behave poorly in the ``large
$p$, small $n$'' setting, in which the problem dimension $p$ is comparable to
or larger than the sample size $n$. This paper studies PCA in this
high-dimensional regime, but under the additional assumption that the maximal
eigenvector is sparse, say, with at most $k$ nonzero components. We consider a
spiked covariance model in which a base matrix is perturbed by adding a
$k$-sparse maximal eigenvector, and we analyze two computationally tractable
methods for recovering the support set of this maximal eigenvector, as follows:
(a) a simple diagonal thresholding method, which transitions from success to
failure as a function of the rescaled sample size
$\theta_{\mathrm{dia}}(n,p,k)=n/[k^2\log(p-k)]$; and (b) a more sophisticated
semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, which succeeds once the rescaled
sample size $\theta_{\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)=n/[k\log(p-k)]$ is larger than a
critical threshold. In addition, we prove that no method, including the best
method which has exponential-time complexity, can succeed in recovering the
support if the order parameter $\theta_{\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)$ is below a
threshold. Our results thus highlight an interesting trade-off between
computational and statistical efficiency in high-dimensional inference.

determine the most likely state of a student. As we describe, a representation
of a knowledge space using learning sequences (basic words of an antimatroid)
allows more general learning spaces to be implemented with similar algorithmic
complexity. We show how to define a learning space from a set of learning
sequences, find a set of learning sequences that concisely represents a given
learning space, generate all states of a learning space represented in this
way, and integrate this state generation procedure into a knowledge assessment
algorithm. We also describe some related theoretical results concerning
projections of learning spaces, decomposition and dimension of learning spaces,
and algebraic representation of learning spaces.

overhead, which is typically much lower than conventional routing protocols
such as AODV. However, the performance of geographic routing is impacted by
physical voids, and localization errors. Accordingly, virtual coordinate
systems (VCS) were proposed as an alternative approach that is resilient to
localization errors and that naturally routes around physical voids. However,
VCS also faces virtual anomalies, causing their performance to trail geographic
routing. In existing VCS routing protocols, there is a lack of an effective
stateless and delivery guaranteed complementary routing algorithm that can be
used to traverse voids. Most proposed solutions use variants of flooding or
blind searching when a void is encountered. In this paper, we propose a
spanning-path virtual coordinate system which can be used as a complete routing
algorithm or as the complementary algorithm to greedy forwarding that is
invoked when voids are encountered. With this approach, and for the first time,
we demonstrate a stateless and delivery guaranteed geometric routing algorithm
on VCS. When used in conjunction with our previously proposed aligned virtual
coordinate system (AVCS), it out-performs not only all geometric routing
protocols on VCS, but also geographic routing with accurate location
information.

verbalization. The method was tested in an experiment where the unconscious
preferences of the subjects for various artworks were investigated. In the
experiment, two lessons were learned. The first is that it helps the subjects
become aware of their unconscious preferences to verbalize weak preferences as
compared with strong preferences through discussion over preference diagrams.
The second is that it is effective to introduce an adjustable factor into
visualization to adapt to the differences in the subjects and to foster their
mutual understanding.

We
analyse the number of $k$-cycles for the solution and their dependence on the
symmetry of the random matrix. We observe that for a symmetric matrix one and
two-cycles are dominant in the optimal solution. In the antisymmetric case the
situation is the opposite and the one and two-cycles are suppressed. We solve
the model for a pure random matrix (without correlations between its entries)
and give analytic arguments to explain the numerical results in the symmetric
and antisymmetric case. We show that the results can be explained to great
accuracy by a simple ansatz that connects the expected number of $k$-cycles to
that of one and two cycles.

biochemical AND gate. The obtained data are modeled within the rate-equation
approach, with the aim to map out the gate function and cast it in the language
of logic variables appropriate for analysis of Boolean logic for scalability.
In order to minimize &quot;analog&quot; noise, we consider a theoretical approach for
determining an optimal set for the process parameters to minimize &quot;analog&quot;
noise amplification for gate concatenation. We establish that under optimized
conditions, presently studied biochemical gates can be concatenated for up to
order 10 processing steps. Beyond that, new paradigms for avoiding noise
build-up will have to be developed. We offer a general discussion of the ideas
and possible future challenges for both experimental and theoretical research
for advancing scalable biochemical computing.

been exploited many times in complexity theory: for example, by Lovasz to
determine the Shannon capacity of the pentagon; to show a direct sum theorem
for non-deterministic communication complexity and direct product theorems for
discrepancy; and in interactive proof systems to show parallel repetition
theorems for restricted classes of games.
  Despite all these examples of product theorems--some going back nearly thirty
years--it was only recently that Mittal and Szegedy began to develop a general
theory to explain when and why semidefinite programs behave perfectly under
product. This theory captured many examples in the literature, but there were
also some notable exceptions which it could not explain--namely, an early
parallel repetition result of Feige and Lovasz, and a direct product theorem
for the discrepancy method of communication complexity by Lee, Shraibman, and
Spalek.
  We extend the theory of Mittal and Szegedy to explain these cases as well.
Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, our theory captures all examples of
semidefinite product theorems in the literature.

in data volumes and distributed processing in particle physics. Data volumes of
hundreds of Terabytes will be shipped to Tier-2 centres for analysis by the LHC
experiments using the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG).
  In many countries Tier-2 centres are distributed between a number of
institutes, e.g., the geographically spread Tier-2s of GridPP in the UK. This
presents a number of challenges for experiments to utilise these centres
efficaciously, as CPU and storage resources may be sub-divided and exposed in
smaller units than the experiment would ideally want to work with. In addition,
unhelpful mismatches between storage and CPU at the individual centres may be
seen, which make efficient exploitation of a Tier-2's resources difficult.
  One method of addressing this is to unify the storage across a distributed
Tier-2, presenting the centres' aggregated storage as a single system. This
greatly simplifies data management for the VO, which then can access a greater
amount of data across the Tier-2. However, such an approach will lead to
scenarios where analysis jobs on one site's batch system must access data
hosted on another site.
  We investigate this situation using the Glasgow and Edinburgh clusters, which
are part of the ScotGrid distributed Tier-2. In particular we look at how to
mitigate the problems associated with ``distant'' data access and discuss the
security implications of having LAN access protocols traverse the WAN between
centres.

  CEC2007 - IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC2007, singapore :

organizations often results in good performance and high quality solutions. For
successful and efficient use of GAs, it is not enough to simply apply simple
GAs (SGAs). In addition, it is necessary to find a proper representation for
the problem and to develop appropriate search operators that fit well to the
properties of the genotype encoding. The representation must at least be able
to encode all possible solutions of an optimization problem, and genetic
operators such as crossover and mutation should be applicable to it. In this
paper, serial alternation strategies between two codings are formulated in the
framework of dynamic change of genotype encoding in GAs for function
optimization. Likewise, a new variant of GAs for difficult optimization
problems denoted {\it Split-and-Merge} GA (SM-GA) is developed using a parallel
implementation of an SGA and evolving a dynamic exchange of individual
representation in the context of Dual Coding concept. Numerical experiments
show that the evolved SM-GA significantly outperforms an SGA with static single
coding.

Algorithms (cGA). This new scheme allows to enhance diversity and to control
the selective pressure which are two important issues in Genetic Algorithms,
especially when trying to solve difficult optimization problems. Varying the
anisotropic degree of selection allows swapping from a cellular to an island
model of parallel genetic algorithm. Measures of performances and diversity
have been performed on one well-known problem: the Quadratic Assignment Problem
which is known to be difficult to optimize. Experiences show that, tuning the
anisotropic degree, we can find the accurate trade-off between cGA and island
models to optimize performances of parallel evolutionary algorithms. This
trade-off can be interpreted as the suitable degree of migration among
subpopulations in a parallel Genetic Algorithm.

heuristic explorations. Several interesting questions arise from its
deceptively simple set of rules. How many distinct Su-Doku grids are there? How
to find a solution to a Su-Doku puzzle? Is there a unique solution to a given
Su-Doku puzzle? What is a good estimation of a puzzle's difficulty? What is the
minimum puzzle size (the number of &quot;givens&quot;)?
  This paper explores how these questions are related to the well-known
alldifferent constraint which emerges in a wide variety of Constraint
Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and compares various algorithmic approaches based
on different formulations of Su-Doku.

past decade. Different from the past work, this paper considers schedulability
conditions for stochastic real-time tasks. A schedulability condition is first
presented for frame-based stochastic real-time tasks, and several algorithms
are also examined to check the schedulability of a given strategy. An approach
is then proposed based on the schedulability condition to adapt a
continuous-speed-based method to a discrete-speed system. The approach is able
to stay as close as possible to the continuous-speed-based method, but still
guaranteeing the schedulability. It is shown by simulations that the energy
saving can be more than 20% for some system configurations

does not produce the desired result all the time. It is a classic example of a
greedy method in that it is based on a series of locally optimal choices. This
note describes an analysis that determines how good the heuristic is on an 8 X
8 chessboard. The order of appearance in a permutation of the eight possible
moves a knight can make determines the path the knight takes. A computer
analysis is done of the 8! permutations of the order of a knights moves in
Warnsdorffs rule on an 8 X 8 chessboard for tours starting on each of the 64
squares. Whenever a tie occurs for moves to vertices that have the lowest
degree, the first of these vertices encountered in the programming loop is
chosen. The number of permutations of the 8! total that yield non-Hamiltonian
paths is tallied. This will be the same value if we consistently choose the
last of these vertices encountered.

observations of a stationary stochastic process $X_0,X_1,...X_n$ has been
considered by many authors from different points of view. It has long been
known through the work of D. Bailey that no universal estimator for
$\textbf{P}(X_{n+1}|X_0,X_1,...X_n)$ can be found which converges to the true
estimator almost surely. Despite this result, for restricted classes of
processes, or for sequences of estimators along stopping times, universal
estimators can be found. We present here a survey of some of the recent work
that has been done along these lines.

Determining which vertices are most &quot;central&quot; in a semantic network is
difficult because one relationship type may be deemed subjectively more
important than another. For this reason, research into semantic network metrics
has focused primarily on context-based rankings (i.e. user prescribed
contexts). Moreover, many of the current semantic network metrics rank semantic
associations (i.e. directed paths between two vertices) and not the vertices
themselves. This article presents a framework for calculating semantically
meaningful primary eigenvector-based metrics such as eigenvector centrality and
PageRank in semantic networks using a modified version of the random walker
model of Markov chain analysis. Random walkers, in the context of this article,
are constrained by a grammar, where the grammar is a user defined data
structure that determines the meaning of the final vertex ranking. The ideas in
this article are presented within the context of the Resource Description
Framework (RDF) of the Semantic Web initiative.

cluster connected to different grid collaborations is introduced. It is
realized by inserting a web-service in addition to the standard Globus Toolkit.
The new web-service performs two main tasks : authenticate the digital
certificate contained in an incoming requests and forward it to the designated
block. The appropriate block is mapped with the username of the block's owner
contained in the digital certificate. It is argued that this algorithm opens an
opportunity for any blocks in a public cluster to join various global grids.

distribution together with some polynomial constraints, does there exist a
quantum state rho and a collection of measurement operators such that (i) the
probability of obtaining a particular outcome when a particular measurement is
performed on rho is specified by the conditional probability distribution, and
(ii) the measurement operators satisfy the constraints. For example, the
constraints might specify that some measurement operators must commute.
  We show that if an instance of the quantum moment problem is unsatisfiable,
then there exists a certificate of a particular form proving this. Our proof is
based on a recent result in algebraic geometry, the noncommutative
Positivstellensatz of Helton and McCullough [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.,
356(9):3721, 2004].
  A special case of the quantum moment problem is to compute the value of
one-round multi-prover games with entangled provers. Under the conjecture that
the provers need only share states in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we
prove that a hierarchy of semidefinite programs similar to the one given by
Navascues, Pironio and Acin [Phys. Rev. Lett., 98:010401, 2007] converges to
the entangled value of the game. It follows that the class of languages
recognized by a multi-prover interactive proof system where the provers share
entanglement is recursive.

Kirchhoff-loop-Johnson-(like)-noise ciphers can easily be integrated on
existing types of digital chips in order to provide secure data communication
between hardware processors, memory chips, hard disks and other units within a
computer or other data processor system. The secure key exchange can take place
at the very first run and the system can renew the key later at random times
with an authenticated fashion to prohibit man-in-the-middle attack. The key can
be stored in flash memories within the communicating chip units at hidden
random addresses among other random bits that are continuously generated by the
secure line but are never actually used. Thus, even if the system is
disassembled, and the eavesdropper can have direct access to the communication
lines between the units, or even if she is trying to use a man-in-the-middle
attack, no information can be extracted. The only way to break the code is to
learn the chip structure, to understand the machine code program and to read
out the information during running by accessing the proper internal ports of
the working chips. However such an attack needs extraordinary resources and
even that can be prohibited by a password lockout. The unconditional security
of commercial algorithms against piracy can be provided in a similar way.

In
one scenario, scalability-related problems in the operation of a repository
reach a point beyond which continued service requires parallelization and hence
federation of the repository infrastructure. In the other scenario, multiple
distributed repositories manage collections of interest to certain communities
or applications, and federation is an approach to present a unified perspective
across these repositories. The high-level, 3-Tier aDORe federation architecture
can be used as a guideline to federate repositories in both cases. This paper
describes the architecture, consisting of core interfaces for federated
repositories in Tier-1, two shared infrastructure components in Tier-2, and a
single-point of access to the federation in Tier-3. The paper also illustrates
two large-scale deployments of the aDORe federation architecture: the aDORe
Archive repository (over 100,000,000 digital objects) at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory and the Ghent University Image Repository federation
(multiple terabytes of image files).

Omega(sqrt(n)). We consider a linear program which is feasible if and only if
there is an approximate polynomial for a given function, and apply the duality
theory. The duality theory says that the primal program has no solution if and
only if its dual has a solution. Therefore one can prove the nonexistence of an
approximate polynomial by exhibiting a dual solution, coined the dual
polynomial. We construct such a polynomial.

algorithm for this problem which is especially suited for low dimensional (say
dimensions at most 12) and for highly-symmetric lattices. We use our
implementation, which drastically outperforms those of current computer algebra
systems, to find the vertices of Voronoi cells and quantizer constants of some
prominent lattices.

Gaussian ensemble. In compressed sensing we are interested in finding the
sparsest solution to the system of equations A x = y for a given y. In general,
whenever the sparsity of x is smaller than half the dimension of y then with
overwhelming probability over A the sparsest solution is unique and can be
found by an exhaustive search over x with an exponential time complexity for
any y. The recent work of Cand\'es, Donoho, and Tao shows that minimization of
the L_1 norm of x subject to A x = y results in the sparsest solution provided
the sparsity of x, say K, is smaller than a certain threshold for a given
number of measurements. Specifically, if the dimension of y approaches the
dimension of x, the sparsity of x should be K &lt; 0.239 N. Here, we consider the
case where x is d-block sparse, i.e., x consists of n = N / d blocks where each
block is either a zero vector or a nonzero vector. Instead of L_1-norm
relaxation, we consider the following relaxation min x \| X_1 \|_2 + \| X_2
\|_2 + ... + \| X_n \|_2, subject to A x = y where X_i = (x_{(i-1)d+1},
x_{(i-1)d+2}, ..., x_{i d}) for i = 1,2, ..., N. Our main result is that as n
-&gt; \infty, the minimization finds the sparsest solution to Ax = y, with
overwhelming probability in A, for any x whose block sparsity is k/n &lt; 1/2 -
O(\epsilon), provided M/N &gt; 1 - 1/d, and d = \Omega(\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon).
The relaxation can be solved in polynomial time using semi-definite
programming.

wireless communication with fiber-like bandwidth under short deployment
timelines. However, atmospheric effects can significantly degrade the
reliability of a free-space optical link. In particular, atmospheric turbulence
causes random fluctuations in the irradiance of the received laser beam,
commonly referred to as scintillation. The scintillation process is slow
compared to the large data rates typical of optical transmission. As such, we
adopt a quasi-static block fading model and study the outage probability of the
channel under the assumption of orthogonal pulse-position modulation. We
investigate the mitigation of scintillation through the use of multiple lasers
and multiple apertures, thereby creating a multiple-input multiple output
(MIMO) channel. Non-ideal photodetection is also assumed such that the combined
shot noise and thermal noise are considered as signal-independent Additive
Gaussian white noise. Assuming perfect receiver channel state information
(CSI), we compute the signal-to-noise ratio exponents for the cases when the
scintillation is lognormal, exponential and gamma-gamma distributed, which
cover a wide range of atmospheric turbulence conditions. Furthermore, we
illustrate very large gains, in some cases larger than 15 dB, when transmitter
CSI is also available by adapting the transmitted electrical power.

approximation (strengthening and/or weakening) of a propositional
knowledge-base can be used to speed up query processing, at the expense of
completeness. In this classical approach, querying uses Horn over- and
under-approximations of a given knowledge-base, which is represented as a
propositional formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Along with the class of
Horn functions, one could imagine other Boolean function classes that might
serve the same purpose, owing to attractive deduction-computational properties
similar to those of the Horn functions. Indeed, Zanuttini has suggested that
the class of affine Boolean functions could be useful in knowledge compilation
and has presented an affine approximation algorithm. Since CNF is awkward for
presenting affine functions, Zanuttini considers both a sets-of-models
representation and the use of modulo 2 congruence equations. In this paper, we
propose an algorithm based on reduced ordered binary decision diagrams
(ROBDDs). This leads to a representation which is more compact than the sets of
models and, once we have established some useful properties of affine Boolean
functions, a more efficient algorithm.

Private handshaking is a more private form of secret handshaking, because it

definition of a handshaking protocol to allow and test for membership of
multiple groups simultaneously. We present simple and efficient protocols for
both the single group and multiple group membership case.
  Private handshaking is a useful tool for mutual authentication, demanded by
many pervasive applications (including RFID) for privacy. Our implementations
are efficient enough to support such usually resource constrained scenarios.

popular way of communicating for Internet users. This also applies to
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems and merging these two have already proven to be
successful (e.g. Skype). Even the existing standards of VoIP provide an
assurance of security and Quality of Service (QoS), however, these features are
usually optional and supported by limited number of implementations. As a
result, the lack of mandatory and widely applicable QoS and security guaranties
makes the contemporary VoIP systems vulnerable to attacks and network
disturbances. In this paper we are facing these issues and propose the SecMon
system, which simultaneously provides a lightweight security mechanism and
improves quality parameters of the call. SecMon is intended specially for VoIP
service over P2P networks and its main advantage is that it provides
authentication, data integrity services, adaptive QoS and (D)DoS attack
detection. Moreover, the SecMon approach represents a low-bandwidth consumption
solution that is transparent to the users and possesses a self-organizing
capability. The above-mentioned features are accomplished mainly by utilizing
two information hiding techniques: digital audio watermarking and network
steganography. These techniques are used to create covert channels that serve
as transport channels for lightweight QoS measurement's results. Furthermore,
these metrics are aggregated in a reputation system that enables best route
path selection in the P2P network. The reputation system helps also to mitigate
(D)DoS attacks, maximize performance and increase transmission efficiency in
the network.

  (2006) 1</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A computational model of the construction of word meaning through exposure to
texts is built in order to simulate the effects of co-occurrence values on word
semantic similarities, paragraph by paragraph. Semantic similarity is here
viewed as association. It turns out that the similarity between two words W1
and W2 strongly increases with a co-occurrence, decreases with the occurrence
of W1 without W2 or W2 without W1, and slightly increases with high-order
co-occurrences. Therefore, operationalizing similarity as a frequency of
co-occurrence probably introduces a bias: first, there are cases in which there
is similarity without co-occurrence and, second, the frequency of co-occurrence
overestimates similarity.

indefinite kernels. Instead of directly minimizing or stabilizing a nonconvex
loss function, our algorithm simultaneously computes support vectors and a
proxy kernel matrix used in forming the loss. This can be interpreted as a
penalized kernel learning problem where indefinite kernel matrices are treated
as a noisy observations of a true Mercer kernel. Our formulation keeps the
problem convex and relatively large problems can be solved efficiently using
the projected gradient or analytic center cutting plane methods. We compare the
performance of our technique with other methods on several classic data sets.

that is, deciding whether a given message $M$ can be deduced from a set of
messages $\Gamma$ under the theory of blind signatures and arbitrary convergent
equational theories modulo associativity and commutativity (AC) of certain
binary operators. The traditional formulations of intruder deduction are
usually given in natural-deduction-like systems and proving decidability
requires significant effort in showing that the rules are &quot;local&quot; in some
sense. By using the well-known translation between natural deduction and
sequent calculus, we recast the intruder deduction problem as proof search in
sequent calculus, in which locality is immediate. Using standard proof
theoretic methods, such as permutability of rules and cut elimination, we show
that the intruder deduction problem can be reduced, in polynomial time, to the
elementary deduction problems, which amounts to solving certain equations in
the underlying individual equational theories. We further show that this result
extends to combinations of disjoint AC-convergent theories whereby the
decidability of intruder deduction under the combined theory reduces to the
decidability of elementary deduction in each constituent theory. Although
various researchers have reported similar results for individual cases, our
work shows that these results can be obtained using a systematic and uniform
methodology based on the sequent calculus.

semantic network (i.e a directed labeled network) to a directed network (i.e. a
directed unlabeled network). The edge label in the semantic network is
represented as a topological feature of the directed network. Also, there
exists an injective function that maps a directed network to an undirected
network (i.e. an undirected unlabeled network). The edge directionality in the
directed network is represented as a topological feature of the undirected
network. Through function composition, there exists an injective function that
maps a semantic network to an undirected network. Thus, aside from space
constraints, the semantic network construct does not have any modeling
functionality that is not possible with either a directed or undirected network
representation. Two proofs of this idea will be presented. The first is a proof
of the aforementioned function composition concept. The second is a simpler
proof involving an undirected binary encoding of a semantic network.

  Parts-of-Speech Tagger Errors Do Not Necessarily Degrade Accuracy in
  Extracting Information from Biomedical Text. The Python Papers 3 (1): 65-80</journal-ref><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/</license><abstract>  A recent study reported development of Muscorian, a generic text processing
tool for extracting protein-protein interactions from text that achieved
comparable performance to biomedical-specific text processing tools. This
result was unexpected since potential errors from a series of text analysis
processes is likely to adversely affect the outcome of the entire process. Most
biomedical entity relationship extraction tools have used biomedical-specific
parts-of-speech (POS) tagger as errors in POS tagging and are likely to affect
subsequent semantic analysis of the text, such as shallow parsing. This study
aims to evaluate the parts-of-speech (POS) tagging accuracy and attempts to
explore whether a comparable performance is obtained when a generic POS tagger,
MontyTagger, was used in place of MedPost, a tagger trained in biomedical text.
Our results demonstrated that MontyTagger, Muscorian's POS tagger, has a POS
tagging accuracy of 83.1% when tested on biomedical text. Replacing MontyTagger
with MedPost did not result in a significant improvement in entity relationship
extraction from text; precision of 55.6% from MontyTagger versus 56.8% from
MedPost on directional relationships and 86.1% from MontyTagger compared to
81.8% from MedPost on nondirectional relationships. This is unexpected as the
potential for poor POS tagging by MontyTagger is likely to affect the outcome
of the information extraction. An analysis of POS tagging errors demonstrated
that 78.5% of tagging errors are being compensated by shallow parsing. Thus,
despite 83.1% tagging accuracy, MontyTagger has a functional tagging accuracy
of 94.6%.

lattice as basis, there is the question of how the symmetry between the
different directions of motion can be restored as far as possible but with
limited computational effort. This question is equivalent to the question ''How
important is the orientation of the axis of discretization for the result of
the simulation?'' An optimization in terms of symmetry can be combined with the
implementation of higher and heterogeniously distributed walking speeds by
representing different walking speeds via different amounts of cells an agent
may move during one round. Therefore all different possible neighborhoods for
speeds up to v = 10 (cells per round) will be examined for the amount of
deviation from radial symmetry. Simple criteria will be stated which will allow
find an optimal neighborhood for each speed. It will be shown that following
these criteria even the best mixture of steps in Moore and von Neumann
neighborhoods is unable to reproduce the optimal neighborhood for a speed as
low as 4.

region in case of two single-antenna users communicating with a multi-antenna
base station. Due to the MSE duality this holds both for the vector broadcast
channel and the dual multiple access channel. Increasing the number of users to
more than two, we show by means of a simple counter-example that the resulting
MSE region is not necessarily convex any longer, even under the assumption of
single-antenna users. In conjunction with our former observation that the two
user MSE region is not necessarily convex for two multi-antenna users, this
extends and corrects the hitherto existing notion of the MSE region geometry.

channel (MARC) where the multiaccess signal received at the destination from
the K sources and relay is a degraded version of the signal received at the
relay from all sources, given the transmit signal at the relay. An outer bound
on the capacity region is developed using cutset bounds. An achievable rate
region is obtained for the decode-and-forward (DF) strategy. It is shown that
for every choice of input distribution, the rate regions for the inner (DF) and
outer bounds are given by the intersection of two K-dimensional polymatroids,
one resulting from the multiaccess link at the relay and the other from that at
the destination. Although the inner and outer bound rate regions are not
identical in general, for both cases, a classical result on the intersection of
two polymatroids is used to show that the intersection belongs to either the
set of active cases or inactive cases, where the two bounds on the K-user
sum-rate are active or inactive, respectively. It is shown that DF achieves the
capacity region for a class of degraded Gaussian MARCs in which the relay has a
high SNR link to the destination relative to the multiaccess link from the
sources to the relay. Otherwise, DF is shown to achieve the sum-capacity for an
active class of degraded Gaussian MARCs for which the DF sum-rate is maximized
by a polymatroid intersection belonging to the set of active cases. This class
is shown to include the class of symmetric Gaussian MARCs where all users
transmit at the same power.

This version supersedes previuos ones</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We cryptanalyse here two variants of the McEliece cryptosystem based on
quasi-cyclic codes. Both aim at reducing the key size by restricting the public
and secret generator matrices to be in quasi-cyclic form. The first variant
considers subcodes of a primitive BCH code. We prove that this variant is not
secure by finding and solving a linear system satisfied by the entries of the
secret permutation matrix.
  The other variant uses quasi-cyclic low density parity-check codes. This
scheme was devised to be immune against general attacks working for McEliece
type cryptosystems based on low density parity-check codes by choosing in the
McEliece scheme more general one-to-one mappings than permutation matrices. We
suggest here a structural attack exploiting the quasi-cyclic structure of the
code and a certain weakness in the choice of the linear transformations that
hide the generator matrix of the code. Our analysis shows that with high
probability a parity-check matrix of a punctured version of the secret code can
be recovered in cubic time complexity in its length. The complete
reconstruction of the secret parity-check matrix of the quasi-cyclic low
density parity-check codes requires the search of codewords of low weight which
can be done with about $2^{37}$ operations for the specific parameters
proposed.

systems with finite rate feedback. The goal is to understand how to efficiently
employ the given finite feedback resource to maximize the sum rate by
characterizing the performance analytically. Towards this, we propose a joint
quantization and feedback strategy: the base station selects the strongest
users, jointly quantizes their strongest eigen-channel vectors and broadcasts a
common feedback to all the users. This joint strategy is different from an
individual strategy, in which quantization and feedback are performed across
users independently, and it improves upon the individual strategy in the same
way that vector quantization improves upon scalar quantization. In our proposed
strategy, the effect of user selection is analyzed by extreme order statistics,
while the effect of joint quantization is quantified by what we term ``the
composite Grassmann manifold''. The achievable sum rate is then estimated by
random matrix theory. Due to its simple implementation and solid performance
analysis, the proposed scheme provides a benchmark for multiaccess MIMO systems
with finite rate feedback.

optimal decision test, without the need for a fusion center, is a problem that
has received considerable attention in the last years. Many consensus
algorithms have been proposed, with convergence conditions depending on the
graph describing the interaction among the nodes. In most works, the graph is
undirected and there are no propagation delays. Only recently, the analysis has
been extended to consensus algorithms incorporating propagation delays. In this
work, we propose a consensus algorithm able to converge to a globally optimal
decision statistic, using a wideband wireless network, governed by a fairly
simple MAC mechanism, where each link is a multipath, frequency-selective,
channel. The main contribution of the paper is to derive necessary and
sufficient conditions on the network topology and sufficient conditions on the
channel transfer functions guaranteeing the exponential convergence of the
consensus algorithm to a globally optimal decision value, for any bounded delay
condition.

stationary ergodic. Namely, three problems are considered: goodness-of-fit (or
identity) testing, process classification, and the change point problem. For
each of the problems a test is constructed that is asymptotically accurate for
the case when the data is generated by stationary ergodic processes. The tests
are based on empirical estimates of distributional distance.

scheduler by using a set of rules that involve domain knowledge. This chapter
presents a Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) for the nurse scheduling
problem that chooses such suitable scheduling rules from a set for each nurses
assignment. Based on the idea of using probabilistic models, the BOA builds a
Bayesian network for the set of promising solutions and samples these networks
to generate new candidate solutions. Computational results from 52 real data
instances demonstrate the success of this approach. It is also suggested that
the learning mechanism in the proposed algorithm may be suitable for other
scheduling problems.

hydrocyclone operation. In this manner, using Self Organizing Map (SOM) as
preprocessing step, best crisp granules of data are obtained. Then, using a
combining of SOM and rough set theory (RST)-called SORST-, the dominant rules
on the information table, obtained from laboratory tests, are extracted. Based
on these rules, an approximate estimation on decision attribute is fulfilled.
Finally, a brief comparison of this method with the SOM-NFIS system (briefly
SONFIS) is highlighted.

degrades performance. Clutching can be reduced with high control-display gain

control eliminates clutching completely, but can make precise selection
difficult. We show that hybrid position-rate control can outperform position
control by 20% when there is significant clutching, even when using pointer
acceleration. Unlike previous work, our RubberEdge technique eliminates
trajectory and velocity discontinuities. We derive predictive models for
position control with clutching and hybrid control, and present a prototype
RubberEdge position-rate control device including initial user feedback.

a dynamic way. The second step, consists to characterise the situation and
finally, it is compared with other similar known situations. In this paper, we
present an information modelling of an observed environment, that we have
applied on the RoboCupRescue Simulation System. Information coming from the
environment are formatted according to a taxonomy and using semantic features.
The latter are defined thanks to a fine ontology of the domain and are managed
by factual agents that aim to represent dynamically the current situation.

  (2006) 36-47</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A new computer haptics algorithm to be used in general interactive
manipulations of deformable virtual objects is presented. In multimodal
interactive simulations, haptic feedback computation often comes from contact
forces. Subsequently, the fidelity of haptic rendering depends significantly on
contact space modeling. Contact and friction laws between deformable models are
often simplified in up to date methods. They do not allow a &quot;realistic&quot;
rendering of the subtleties of contact space physical phenomena (such as slip
and stick effects due to friction or mechanical coupling between contacts). In
this paper, we use Signorini's contact law and Coulomb's friction law as a
computer haptics basis. Real-time performance is made possible thanks to a
linearization of the behavior in the contact space, formulated as the so-called
Delassus operator, and iteratively solved by a Gauss-Seidel type algorithm.
Dynamic deformation uses corotational global formulation to obtain the Delassus
operator in which the mass and stiffness ratio are dissociated from the
simulation time step. This last point is crucial to keep stable haptic
feedback. This global approach has been packaged, implemented, and tested.
Stable and realistic 6D haptic feedback is demonstrated through a clipping task
experiment.

profiles (alternatively called preferences / favourites / bookmarks file) will
be used. URLs will be classified using the DMOZ (Directory Mozilla) database of
the Open Directory Project as our ontology. This will then be used as the data
for the Artificial Immune Systems rather than the actual addresses. The first
attempt will involve using a simple classification code number coupled with the
number of pages within that classification code. However, this implementation
does not make use of the hierarchical tree-like structure of DMOZ.
Consideration will then be given to the construction of a similarity measure
for web profiles that makes use of this hierarchical information to build a
better-informed Artificial Immune System.

that uses only limited, local, information about the realization of the graph.
In some random graph models it is possible to define such algorithms which
produce short paths when routing from any vertex to any other, while for others
it is not.
  We consider random graphs with random costs assigned to the edges. In this
situation, we use the methods of stochastic dynamic programming to create a
decentralized search method which attempts to minimize the total cost, rather
than the number of steps, of each path. We show that it succeeds in doing so
among all decentralized search algorithms which monotonically approach the
destination. Our algorithm depends on knowing the expected cost of routing from
every vertex to any other, but we show that this may be calculated iteratively,
and in practice can be easily estimated from the cost of previous routes and
compressed into a small routing table. The methods applied here can also be
applied directly in other situations, such as efficient searching in graphs
with varying vertex degrees.

of research has been done to solve these problems heuristically. However, most
of the previous approaches are problem-specific and research into the
development of a general scheduling algorithm is still in its infancy.
  Mimicking the natural evolutionary process of the survival of the fittest,
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have attracted much attention in solving difficult
scheduling problems in recent years. Some obstacles exist when using GAs: there
is no canonical mechanism to deal with constraints, which are commonly met in
most real-world scheduling problems, and small changes to a solution are
difficult. To overcome both difficulties, indirect approaches have been
presented (in [1] and [2]) for nurse scheduling and driver scheduling, where
GAs are used by mapping the solution space, and separate decoding routines then
build solutions to the original problem.

$\epsilon$-efficient solutions (denote by $E_\epsilon$) of a multi-objective
optimization problem with stochastic search algorithms has been proposed. It
was proven that such an algorithm produces -- under mild assumptions on the
process to generate new candidate solutions --a sequence of archives which
converges to $E_{\epsilon}$ in the limit and in the probabilistic sense. The
result, though satisfactory for most discrete MOPs, is at least from the
practical viewpoint not sufficient for continuous models: in this case, the set
of approximate solutions typically forms an $n$-dimensional object, where $n$
denotes the dimension of the parameter space, and thus, it may come to
perfomance problems since in practise one has to cope with a finite archive.
Here we focus on obtaining finite and tight approximations of $E_\epsilon$, the
latter measured by the Hausdorff distance. We propose and investigate a novel
archiving strategy theoretically and empirically. For this, we analyze the
convergence behavior of the algorithm, yielding bounds on the obtained
approximation quality as well as on the cardinality of the resulting
approximation, and present some numerical results.

Satisfiability (SAT) and Constraint Programming (CP). In SAT, the
identification of symmetry breaking predicates (SBPs) is a well-known, often
effective, technique for solving hard problems. The identification of SBPs in
SAT has been the subject of significant improvements in recent years, resulting
in more compact SBPs and more effective algorithms. The identification of SBPs
has also been applied to pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, showing that symmetry
breaking can also be an effective technique for PB constraints. This paper
extends further the application of SBPs, and shows that SBPs can be identified
and used in Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), as well as in its most well-known
variants, including partial MaxSAT, weighted MaxSAT and weighted partial
MaxSAT. As with SAT and PB, symmetry breaking predicates for MaxSAT and
variants are shown to be effective for a representative number of problem
domains, allowing solving problem instances that current state of the art
MaxSAT solvers could not otherwise solve.

widely studied in the frequency-flat case. This work focuses on the more
relevant frequency selective case, where some important new aspects emerge. We
consider a MIMO-OFDM broadcast channel and compare achievable ergodic rates
under three channel state feedback schemes: analog feedback, direction
quantized feedback and &quot;time-domain&quot; channel quantized feedback. The first two
schemes are direct extensions of previously proposed schemes. The third scheme
is novel, and it is directly inspired by rate-distortion theory of Gaussian
correlated sources. For each scheme we derive the conditions under which the
system achieves full multiplexing gain. The key difference with respect to the
widely treated frequency-flat case is that in MIMO-OFDM the frequency-domain
channel transfer function is a Gaussian correlated source. The new time-domain
quantization scheme takes advantage of the channel frequency correlation
structure and outperforms the other schemes. Furthermore, it is by far simpler
to implement than complicated spherical vector quantization. In particular, we
observe that no structured codebook design and vector quantization is actually
needed for efficient channel state information feedback.

\emph{Algebraic Eraser} scheme for key agreement over an insecure channel,
using a novel hybrid of infinite and finite noncommutative groups. They also
introduced the \emph{Colored Burau Key Agreement Protocol (CBKAP)}, a concrete
realization of this scheme.
  We present general, efficient heuristic algorithms, which extract the shared
key out of the public information provided by CBKAP. These algorithms are,
according to heuristic reasoning and according to massive experiments,
successful for all sizes of the security parameters, assuming that the keys are
chosen with standard distributions.
  Our methods come from probabilistic group theory (permutation group actions
and expander graphs). In particular, we provide a simple algorithm for finding
short expressions of permutations in $S_n$, as products of given random
permutations. Heuristically, our algorithm gives expressions of length
$O(n^2\log n)$, in time and space $O(n^3)$. Moreover, this is provable from
\emph{the Minimal Cycle Conjecture}, a simply stated hypothesis concerning the
uniform distribution on $S_n$. Experiments show that the constants in these
estimations are small. This is the first practical algorithm for this problem
for $n\ge 256$.
  Remark: \emph{Algebraic Eraser} is a trademark of SecureRF. The variant of
CBKAP actually implemented by SecureRF uses proprietary distributions, and thus
our results do not imply its vulnerability. See also arXiv:abs/12020598

measure. That is, we investigate what distortion guarantees can be made with
respect to distortion measure $\tilde{\rho}$, for a source code designed such
that it achieves distortion less than $D$ with respect to distortion measure
$\rho$. We find a single-letter characterization of this mismatch distortion
and study properties of this quantity. These results give insight into the
robustness of lossy source coding with respect to modeling errors in the
distortion measure. They also provide guidelines on how to choose a good
tractable approximation of an intractable distortion measure.

  Notation</title><categories>cs.LO</categories><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/</license><abstract>  Weak affine light typing (WALT) assigns light affine linear formulae as types
to a subset of lambda-terms of System F. WALT is poly-time sound: if a
lambda-term M has type in WALT, M can be evaluated with a polynomial cost in
the dimension of the derivation that gives it a type. The evaluation proceeds
under any strategy of a rewriting relation which is a mix of both call-by-name
and call-by-value beta-reductions. WALT weakens, namely generalizes, the notion
of &quot;stratification of deductions&quot;, common to some Light Systems -- those
logical systems, derived from Linear logic, to characterize the set of
Polynomial functions -- . A weaker stratification allows to define a
compositional embedding of Safe recursion on notation (SRN) into WALT. It turns
out that the expressivity of WALT is strictly stronger than the one of the
known Light Systems. The embedding passes through the representation of a
subsystem of SRN. It is obtained by restricting the composition scheme of SRN
to one that can only use its safe variables linearly. On one side, this
suggests that SRN, in fact, can be redefined in terms of more primitive
constructs. On the other, the embedding of SRN into WALT enjoys the two
following remarkable aspects. Every datatype, required by the embedding, is
represented from scratch, showing the strong structural proof-theoretical roots
of WALT. Moreover, the embedding highlights a stratification structure of the
normal and safe arguments, normally hidden inside the world of SRN-normal/safe
variables: the less an argument is &quot;polyomially impredicative&quot;, the deeper, in
a formal, proof-theoretical sense, it is represented inside WALT. Finally,
since WALT is SRN-complete it is also polynomial-time complete since SRN is.

consider different variations of a memetic algorithm approach to the GTSP. The
aim of this paper is to present a new memetic algorithm for GTSP with a
powerful local search procedure. The experiments show that the proposed
algorithm clearly outperforms all of the known heuristics with respect to both
solution quality and running time. While the other memetic algorithms were
designed only for the symmetric GTSP, our algorithm can solve both symmetric
and asymmetric instances.

Past

methods are used and confronted against numerical simulations and exact master
equation. When the length of memory of players increases to infinity the model
undergoes an absorbing-state phase transition. Performance of examined
strategies is checked in the prisoner' dilemma game. It turns out that it is
advantageous to have a large memory in symmetric games, but it is better to
have a short memory in asymmetric ones.

fading channels with quantized feedback and partial power control. A fixed-rate
communication system is considered. It is known from the literature that with
error-free feedback, the outage-optimal quantizer for power control has a
circular structure. Moreover, the diversity gain of the system increases
polynomially with the cardinality of the power control codebook. Here, a
similar system is studied, but when the feedback link is error-prone. We prove
that in the high-SNR regime, the optimal quantizer structure with noisy
feedback is still circular and the optimal Voronoi regions are contiguous
non-zero probability intervals. Furthermore, the optimal power control codebook
resembles a channel optimized scalar quantizer (COSQ), i.e., the Voronoi
regions merge with erroneous feedback information. Using a COSQ, the outage
performance of the system is superior to that of a no-feedback scheme. However,
asymptotic analysis shows that the diversity gain of the system is the same as
a no-CSIT scheme if there is a non-zero and non-vanishing feedback error
probability.

validity of their spreadsheets. They are beginning to understand the
spreadsheet error literature, including what it tells them about the need for
comprehensive spreadsheet testing. However, controlling for fraud will require
a completely new set of capabilities, and a great deal of new research will be
needed to develop fraud control capabilities. This paper discusses the
riskiness of spreadsheets, which can now be quantified to a considerable
degree. It then discusses how to use control frameworks to reduce the dangers
created by spreadsheets. It focuses especially on testing, which appears to be
the most crucial element in spreadsheet controls.

networks. This paper focuses on spatial interference cancelation with perfect
channel state information (CSI), and analyzes the corresponding network
capacity. Specifically, by using multiple antennas, zero-forcing beamforming is
applied at each receiver for canceling the strongest interferers. Given spatial
interference cancelation, the network transmission capacity is analyzed in this
paper, which is defined as the maximum transmitting node density under
constraints on outage and the signal-to-interference-noise ratio. Assuming the
Poisson distribution for the locations of network nodes and spatially i.i.d.
Rayleigh fading channels, mathematical tools from stochastic geometry are
applied for deriving scaling laws for transmission capacity. Specifically, for
small target outage probability, transmission capacity is proved to increase
following a power law, where the exponent is the inverse of the size of antenna
array or larger depending on the pass loss exponent. As shown by simulations,
spatial interference cancelation increases transmission capacity by an order of
magnitude or more even if only one extra antenna is added to each node.

some transform domain referred to as the sparsity basis. For a single spatial
signal, the solution is provided by Compressed Sensing (CS). The question that
we address is, for a sequence of sparse signals, can we do better than CS, if
(a) the sparsity pattern of the signal's transform coefficients' vector changes
slowly over time, and (b) a simple prior model on the temporal dynamics of its
current non-zero elements is available. The overall idea of our solution is to
use CS to estimate the support set of the initial signal's transform vector. At
future times, run a reduced order Kalman filter with the currently estimated
support and estimate new additions to the support set by applying CS to the
Kalman innovations or filtering error (whenever it is &quot;large&quot;).

performance of cellular genetic algorithms. Cellular genetic algorithms are
genetic algorithms where the population is embedded on a toroidal grid. This
structure makes the propagation of the best so far individual slow down, and
allows to keep in the population potentially good solutions. We present two
selective pressure reducing strategies in order to slow down even more the best
solution propagation. We experiment these strategies on a hard optimization
problem, the quadratic assignment problem, and we show that there is a value
for of the control parameter for both which gives the best performance. This
optimal value does not find explanation on only the selective pressure,
measured either by take over time and diversity evolution. This study makes us
conclude that we need other tools than the sole selective pressure measures to
explain the performances of cellular genetic algorithms.

for the size of a data structure is stored in its type. A recursive function
over a sized type is accepted if it is visible in the type system that
recursive calls occur just at a smaller size. This approach is only sound if
the type of the recursive function is admissible, i.e., depends on the size
index in a certain way. To explore the space of admissible functions in the
presence of higher-kinded data types and impredicative polymorphism, a
semantics is developed where sized types are interpreted as functions from
ordinals into sets of strongly normalizing terms. It is shown that upper
semi-continuity of such functions is a sufficient semantic criterion for
admissibility. To provide a syntactical criterion, a calculus for
semi-continuous functions is developed.

key decision makers develop a shared conceptual understanding of complex
decisions, identify sensitivity factors and test management scenarios.
Different modelling approaches are specialist areas in themselves. Model
development can be onerous, expensive, time consuming, and often bewildering.
It is also an iterative process where the true magnitude of the effort, time
and data required is often not fully understood until well into the process.
This paper explores the traditional approaches to strategic planning modelling
commonly used in organisations and considers the application of a real-options
approach to match and benefit from the increasing uncertainty in today's
rapidly changing world.

Random Access Machine (RAM) model except that the HMM has a non-uniform memory
organized in a hierarchy of levels numbered 1 through h. The cost of accessing
a memory location increases with the level number, and accesses to memory
locations belonging to the same level cost the same. Formally, the cost of a
single access to the memory location at address a is given by m(a), where m: N
-&gt; N is the memory cost function, and the h distinct values of m model the
different levels of the memory hierarchy.
  We study the problem of constructing and storing a binary search tree (BST)
of minimum cost, over a set of keys, with probabilities for successful and
unsuccessful searches, on the HMM with an arbitrary number of memory levels,
and for the special case h=2.
  While the problem of constructing optimum binary search trees has been well
studied for the standard RAM model, the additional parameter m for the HMM
increases the combinatorial complexity of the problem. We present two dynamic
programming algorithms to construct optimum BSTs bottom-up. These algorithms
run efficiently under some natural assumptions about the memory hierarchy. We
also give an efficient algorithm to construct a BST that is close to optimum,
by modifying a well-known linear-time approximation algorithm for the RAM
model. We conjecture that the problem of constructing an optimum BST for the
HMM with an arbitrary memory cost function m is NP-complete.

subject their spreadsheets to post-development testing to reduce errors. This
may be because spreadsheet developers are overconfident in the accuracy of
their spreadsheets. This conjecture is plausible because overconfidence is
present in a wide variety of human cognitive domains, even among experts. This
paper describes two experiments in overconfidence in spreadsheet development.
The first is a pilot study to determine the existence of overconfidence. The
second tests a manipulation to reduce overconfidence and errors. The
manipulation is modestly successful, indicating that overconfidence reduction
is a promising avenue to pursue.

solve such PDEs involving space and time variables arising from wave
propagation phenomena in important applications in science and engineering.
  To support an accurate and efficient solution procedure using SDG methods and
to exploit the flexibility of these methods, we give a meshing algorithm to
construct an unstructured simplicial spacetime mesh over an arbitrary
simplicial space domain. Our algorithm is the first spacetime meshing algorithm
suitable for efficient solution of nonlinear phenomena in anisotropic media
using novel discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods for implicit
solutions directly in spacetime. Given a triangulated d-dimensional Euclidean
space domain M (a simplicial complex) and initial conditions of the underlying
hyperbolic spacetime PDE, we construct an unstructured simplicial mesh of the
(d+1)-dimensional spacetime domain M x [0,infinity). Our algorithm uses a
near-optimal number of spacetime elements, each with bounded temporal aspect
ratio for any finite prefix M x [0,T] of spacetime. Our algorithm is an
advancing front procedure that constructs the spacetime mesh incrementally, an
extension of the Tent Pitcher algorithm of Ungor and Sheffer (2000).
  In 2DxTime, our algorithm simultaneously adapts the size and shape of
spacetime tetrahedra to a spacetime error indicator. We are able to incorporate
more general front modification operations, such as edge flips and limited mesh
smoothing. Our algorithm represents recent progress towards a meshing algorithm
in 2DxTime to track moving domain boundaries and other singular surfaces such
as shock fronts.

PDEs describing wavelike physical phenomena. When the PDEs are nonlinear, the
speed of propagation of the phenomena, called the wavespeed, at any point in
the spacetime domain is computed as part of the solution. We give an advancing
front algorithm to construct a simplicial mesh of the spacetime domain suitable
for DG solutions. Given a simplicial mesh of a bounded linear or planar space
domain M, we incrementally construct a mesh of the spacetime domain M x
[0,infinity) such that the solution can be computed in constant time per
element. We add a patch of spacetime elements to the mesh at every step. The
boundary of every patch is causal which means that the elements in the patch
can be solved immediately and that the patches in the mesh are partially
ordered by dependence. The elements in a single patch are coupled because they
share implicit faces; however, the number of elements in each patch is bounded.
The main contribution of this paper is sufficient constraints on the progress
in time made by the algorithm at each step which guarantee that a new patch
with causal boundary can be added to the mesh at every step even when the
wavespeed is increasing discontinuously. Our algorithm adapts to the local
gradation of the space mesh as well as the wavespeed that most constrains
progress at each step. Previous algorithms have been restricted at each step by
the maximum wavespeed throughout the entire spacetime domain.

the design of randomized algorithms and has played an important role in several
nontrivial complexity upper bounds. On the other hand, polynomial identity
testing is a well-studied algorithmic problem with efficient randomized
algorithms and the problem of obtaining efficient \emph{deterministic} identity
tests has received a lot of attention recently. The goal of this note is to
compare the isolation lemma with polynomial identity testing: 1. We show that
derandomizing reasonably restricted versions of the isolation lemma implies
circuit size lower bounds. We derive the circuit lower bounds by examining the
connection between the isolation lemma and polynomial identity testing. We give
a randomized polynomial-time identity test for noncommutative circuits of
polynomial degree based on the isolation lemma. Using this result, we show that
derandomizing the isolation lemma implies noncommutative circuit size lower
bounds. The restricted versions of the isolation lemma we consider are natural
and would suffice for the standard applications of the isolation lemma. 2. From
the result of Klivans-Spielman \cite{KS01} we observe that there is a
randomized polynomial-time identity test for commutative circuits of polynomial
degree, also based on a more general isolation lemma for linear forms.
Consequently, derandomization of (a suitable version of) this isolation lemma
also implies circuit size lower bounds in the commutative setting.

data types implementations. In this framework, the conformance relation is
based on the satisfaction of axioms. This makes it possible to formally state
the fundamental concepts of testing: exhaustive test set, testability
hypotheses, oracle. Various criteria for selecting finite test sets have been
proposed. They depend on the form of the axioms, and on the possibilities of
observation of the implementation under test. This last point is related to the
well-known oracle problem. As the main interest of algebraic specifications is
data type abstraction, testing a concrete implementation raises the issue of
the gap between the abstract description and the concrete representation. The
observational semantics of algebraic specifications bring solutions on the
basis of the so-called observable contexts. After a description of testing
methods based on algebraic specifications, the chapter gives a brief
presentation of some tools and case studies, and presents some applications to
other formal methods involving datatypes.

transmit and receive antennas of the order of tens to hundreds. Such large MIMO
systems will be of immense interest because of the very high spectral
efficiencies possible in such systems. We present a low-complexity detector
which achieves uncoded near-exponential diversity performance for hundreds of
antennas (i.e., achieves near SISO AWGN performance in a large MIMO fading
environment) with an average per-bit complexity of just $O(N_tN_r)$, where
$N_t$ and $N_r$ denote the number of transmit and receive antennas,
respectively. With an outer turbo code, the proposed detector achieves good
coded bit error performance as well. For example, in a 600 transmit and 600
receive antennas V-BLAST system with a high spectral efficiency of 200 bps/Hz
(using BPSK and rate-1/3 turbo code), our simulation results show that the
proposed detector performs close to within about 4.6 dB from theoretical
capacity. We also adopt the proposed detector for the low-complexity decoding
of high-rate non-orthogonal space-time block codes (STBC) from division
algebras (DA). For example, we have decoded the $16\times 16$ full-rate
non-orthogonal STBC from DA using the proposed detector and show that it
performs close to within about 5.5 dB of the capacity using 4-QAM and rate-3/4
turbo code at a spectral efficiency of 24 bps/Hz. The practical feasibility of
the proposed high-performance low-complexity detector could potentially trigger
wide interest in the implementation of large MIMO systems. In large MC-CDMA
systems with hundreds of users, the proposed detector is shown to achieve near
single-user performance at an average per-bit complexity linear in number of
users, which is quite appealing for its use in practical CDMA systems.

Comparison Theorem, Legendre's Theorem and Cauchy's Arm Lemma.

convolutional codes are studied. It is shown that within the random ensemble of
such codes based on $s$-partite, $s$-uniform hypergraphs, where $s$ depends
only on the code rate, there exist codes satisfying the Varshamov-Gilbert (VG)
and the Costello lower bound on the minimum distance and the free distance,
respectively. A connection between regular bipartite graphs and tailbiting
codes is shown. Some examples of woven graph codes are presented. Among them an
example of a rate $R_{\rm wg}=1/3$ woven graph code with $d_{\rm free}=32$
based on Heawood's bipartite graph and containing $n=7$ constituent rate
$R^{c}=2/3$ convolutional codes with overall constraint lengths $\nu^{c}=5$ is
given. An encoding procedure for woven graph codes with complexity proportional
to the number of constituent codes and their overall constraint length
$\nu^{c}$ is presented.

determinants. The algorithm is based on a baby steps/giant steps construction
of Krylov subspaces, and computes the determinant as the constant term of a
characteristic polynomial. For matrices over an abstract field and by the
results of Baur and Strassen 1983, the determinant algorithm, actually a
straight-line program, leads to an algorithm with the same complexity for
computing the adjoint of a matrix [Kaltofen 1992]. However, the latter is
obtained by the reverse mode of automatic differentiation and somehow is not
``explicit''. We study this adjoint algorithm, show how it can be implemented
(without resorting to an automatic transformation), and demonstrate its use on
polynomial matrices.

of the author and/or other persons, who contribute with objective and
subjective statements and arguments as well. In this respect, the attitude is
often accomplished by a linguistic modality. As in languages like english,
french and german, the modality is expressed by special verbs like can, must,
may, etc. and the subjunctive mood, an occurrence of modalities often induces
that these verbs take over the role of modality. This is not correct as it is
proven that modality is the instrument of the whole sentence where both the
adverbs, modal particles, punctuation marks, and the intonation of a sentence
contribute. Often, a combination of all these instruments are necessary to
express a modality. In this work, we concern with the finding of modal verbs in
scientific texts as a pre-step towards the discovery of the attitude of an
author. Whereas the input will be an arbitrary text, the output consists of
zones representing modalities.

The convergence property of a modified discrete scheme for the Gaussian
curvature is considered. Furthermore, a new discrete scheme for Gaussian
curvature is resented. We prove that the new scheme converges at the regular
vertex with valence not less than 5. By constructing a counterexample, we also
show that it is impossible for building a discrete scheme for Gaussian
curvature which converges over the regular vertex with valence 4. Finally,
asymptotic errors of several discrete scheme for Gaussian curvature are
compared.

the P complexity class could be equivalent to the NP complexity class. Proof is
provided by demonstrating that as the number of clauses in a NP-complete
problem approaches infinity, the number of input sets processed per computation
performed also approaches infinity when solved by a polynomial time solution.
It is then possible to determine that the only deterministic optimization of a
NP-complete problem that could prove P = NP would be one that examines no more
than a polynomial number of input sets for a given problem.
  It is then shown that subdividing the set of all possible input sets into a
representative polynomial search partition is a problem in the FEXP complexity
class. The findings of this article are combined with the findings of other
articles in this series of 4 articles. The final conclusion will be
demonstrated that P =/= NP.

decentralized search in small-world networks, we conduct an experimental
analysis of a dynamic algorithm that produces small-world networks. We find
that the algorithm adapts robustly to a wide variety of situations in realistic
geographic networks with synthetic test data and with real world data, even
when vertices are uneven and non-homogeneously distributed.
  We investigate the same algorithm in the case where some vertices are more
popular destinations for searches than others, for example obeying power-laws.
We find that the algorithm adapts and adjusts the networks according to the
distributions, leading to improved performance. The ability of the dynamic
process to adapt and create small worlds in such diverse settings suggests a
possible mechanism by which such networks appear in nature.

information at relays, the receiver, and the transmitter if there is a direct
link between the transmitter and receiver. It is assumed that every node in the
network has its own power constraint. A two-step amplify-and-forward protocol
is used, in which the transmitter and relays not only use match filters to form
a beam at the receiver but also adaptively adjust their transmit powers
according to the channel strength information. For a network with any number of
relays and no direct link, the optimal power control is solved analytically.
The complexity of finding the exact solution is linear in the number of relays.
Our results show that the transmitter should always use its maximal power and
the optimal power used at a relay is not a binary function. It can take any
value between zero and its maximum transmit power. Also, this value depends on
the quality of all other channels in addition to the relay's own channels.
Despite this coupling fact, distributive strategies are proposed in which, with
the aid of a low-rate broadcast from the receiver, a relay needs only its own
channel information to implement the optimal power control. Simulated
performance shows that network beamforming achieves the maximal diversity and
outperforms other existing schemes. Then, beamforming in networks with a direct
link are considered. We show that when the direct link exists during the first
step only, the optimal power control is the same as that of networks with no
direct link. For networks with a direct link during the second step, recursive
numerical algorithms are proposed to solve the power control problem.
Simulation shows that by adjusting the transmitter and relays' powers
adaptively, network performance is significantly improved.

attempts to build the first non-trivial quantum computer. This paper briefly
surveys the history, methods, and proposed tools for programming quantum
computers circa late 2007. It is intended to provide an extensive but
non-exhaustive look at work leading up to the current state-of-the-art in
quantum computer programming. Further, it is an attempt to analyze the needed
programming tools for quantum programmers, to use this analysis to predict the
direction in which the field is moving, and to make recommendations for further
development of quantum programming language tools.

ofcprobability densities from a given family. We point out that the technique
of Cauchy random projections (Indyk'06) in this context turns into stochastic
integrals with respect to Cauchy motion.
  For piecewise-linear densities these integrals can be sampled from if one can
sample from the stochastic integral of the function x-&gt;(1,x). We give an
explicit density function for this stochastic integral and present an efficient
sampling algorithm. As a consequence we obtain an efficient algorithm to
approximate the L1-distances with a small relative error.
  For piecewise-polynomial densities we show how to approximately sample from
the distributions resulting from the stochastic integrals. This also results in
an efficient algorithm to approximate the L1-distances, although our inability
to get exact samples worsens the dependence on the parameters.

  Information-Theoretic Perspective</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Modern communication receiver architectures center around digital signal
processing (DSP), with the bulk of the receiver processing being performed on
digital signals obtained after analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). In this
paper, we explore Shannon-theoretic performance limits when ADC precision is
drastically reduced, from typical values of 8-12 bits used in current
communication transceivers, to 1-3 bits. The goal is to obtain insight on
whether DSP-centric transceiver architectures are feasible as communication
bandwidths scale up, recognizing that high-precision ADC at high sampling rates
is either unavailable, or too costly or power-hungry. Specifically, we evaluate
the communication limits imposed by low-precision ADC for the ideal real
discrete-time Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, under an average
power constraint on the input. For an ADC with K quantization bins (i.e., a
precision of log2 K bits), we show that the Shannon capacity is achievable by a
discrete input distribution with at most K + 1 mass points. For 2-bin (1-bit)
symmetric ADC, this result is tightened to show that binary antipodal signaling
is optimum for any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For multi-bit ADC, the capacity
is computed numerically, and the results obtained are used to make the
following encouraging observations regarding system design with low-precision
ADC : (a) even at moderately high SNR of up to 20 dB, 2-3 bit quantization
results in only 10-20% reduction of spectral efficiency, which is acceptable
for large communication bandwidths, (b) standard equiprobable pulse amplitude
modulation with ADC thresholds set to implement maximum likelihood hard
decisions is asymptotically optimum at high SNR, and works well at low to
moderate SNRs as well.

$A$ can be covered by selecting a pairwise disjoint subset of the disks? Rado
conjectured 1/4 and proved $1/4.41$. Motivated by the problem of
channel-assignment for wireless access points, in which use of 3 channels is a
standard practice, we consider a variant where the selected subset of disks
must be 3-colourable with disks of the same colour pairwise-disjoint. For this
variant of the problem, we conjecture that it is always possible to cover at
least $1/1.41$ of the union area and prove $1/2.09$. We also provide an
$O(n^2)$ algorithm to select a subset achieving a $1/2.77$ bound.

Network (VBN) whose set of states is fixed but whose transition matrix can
change from one discrete time step to another. The transition matrix $T_{k}$ of
our DBN for time step $k$ is of the form $Q^{-1}TQ$, where $T$ is a transition
matrix (of a VBN) defined at time step $k$ in the course of the construction of
our DBN and $Q$ is the matrix representation of some randomly chosen
permutation $P$ of the states of our DBN. For each of several classes of such
permutations, we carried out a number of simulations of a DBN with two nodes;
each of our simulations consisted of 1,000 trials of 10,000 time steps each. In
one of our simulations, only six of the 16 possible single-node transition
rules for a VBN with two nodes were visited a total of 300,000 times (over all
1,000 trials). In that simulation, linearity appears to play a significant role
in that three of those six single-node transition rules are transition rules of
a Linear Virtual Boolean Network (LVBN); the other three are the negations of
the first three. We also discuss the notions of a Probabilistic Boolean Network
and a Hidden Markov Model--in both cases, in the context of using an arbitrary
(though not necessarily one-to-one) function to label the states of a VBN.

coding problems by using our previously introduced notion of hash property.
These problems are the fixed-rate lossless universal source coding problem and
the fixed-rate universal channel coding problem. Since an ensemble of sparse
matrices satisfies the hash property requirement, it is proved that we can
construct universal codes by using sparse matrices.

era with the aid of wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. Due to the
sensitiveness of medical data, austere privacy and security are inevitable for
all parts of healthcare systems. However, the constantly evolving nature and
constrained resources of sensors in WSN inflict unavailability of a lucid line
of defense to ensure perfect security. In order to provide holistic security,
protections must be incorporated in every component of healthcare sensor
networks. This paper proposes an efficient security scheme for healthcare
applications of WSN which uses the notion of public key cryptosystem. Our
entire security scheme comprises basically of two parts; a key handshaking
scheme based on simple linear operations and the derivation of decryption key
by a receiver node for a particular sender in the network. Our architecture
allows both base station to node or node to base station secure communications,
and node-to-node secure communications. We consider both the issues of
stringent security and network performance to propose our security scheme.

their scheme is still insecure and vulnerable to four types of forgery attacks.
Hence, in this paper, we prove that, their claim that their scheme is
intractable is incorrect. Also, we show that even an attack based on Sun et

resolve with their proposal.

necessary step. Well-known methods exist to answer this issue in low frequency
domain. Among these, Finite Element Methods, adapted to closed domains, are
quite easy to implement whereas Boundary Element Methods are more adapted to
infinite domains, but may induce singularity problems. In this article, the
described method, the SDM, allows to use both methods in their best application
domain. A new method is also presented to solve the SDM exterior problem.
Instead of using Boundary Element Methods, an original use of Finite Elements
is made. Efficiency of this new version of the Substructure Deletion Method is
discussed.

very large band and are transmitted over multipath channels unknown ahead of
time. This work exploits the I-mmse connection to bound the achievable
data-rate of spreading signals in wideband settings, and to conclude that the
achievable data-rate diminishes as the bandwidth increases due to channel
uncertainty. The result applies to all spreading modulations, i.e. signals that
are evenly spread over the bandwidth available to the communication system,
with SNR smaller than log(W/L)/(W/L) and holds for communications over channels
where the number of paths L is unbounded by sub-linear in the bandwidth W.

concept for two reasons. Firstly, the human immune system provides the human
body with a high level of protection from invading pathogens, in a robust,
self-organised and distributed manner. Secondly, current techniques used in
computer security are not able to cope with the dynamic and increasingly
complex nature of computer systems and their security. It is hoped that
biologically inspired approaches in this area, including the use of
immune-based systems will be able to meet this challenge. Here we review the
algorithms used, the development of the systems and the outcome of their
implementation. We provide an introduction and analysis of the key developments
within this field, in addition to making suggestions for future research.

structure like a ring. The motivation lies in decision making, where scales
that are symmetric w.r.t. 0 are needed in order to represent a kind of symmetry
in the behaviour of the decision maker. A former proposal due to Grabisch was
based on maximum and minimum. In this paper, we propose to build our structure
on t-conorms and t-norms, and we relate this construction to uninorms. We show
that the only way to build a group is to use strict t-norms, and that there is
no way to build a ring. Lastly, we show that the main result of this paper is
connected to the theory of ordered Abelian groups.

of network traffic. This means that their output is of a similarly low level
and as a consequence, is difficult to analyze. Intrusion alert correlation is
the task of automating some of this analysis by grouping related alerts
together. Attack graphs provide an intuitive model for such analysis.
Unfortunately alert flooding attacks can still cause a loss of service on
sensors, and when performing attack graph correlation, there can be a large
number of extraneous alerts included in the output graph. This obscures the
fine structure of genuine attacks and makes them more difficult for human
operators to discern. This paper explores modified correlation algorithms which
attempt to minimize the impact of this attack.

the l1-norm, a problem usually referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we
present a detailed asymptotic analysis of model consistency of the Lasso. For
various decays of the regularization parameter, we compute asymptotic
equivalents of the probability of correct model selection (i.e., variable
selection). For a specific rate decay, we show that the Lasso selects all the
variables that should enter the model with probability tending to one
exponentially fast, while it selects all other variables with strictly positive
probability. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso for
several bootstrapped replications of a given sample, then intersecting the
supports of the Lasso bootstrap estimates leads to consistent model selection.
This novel variable selection algorithm, referred to as the Bolasso, is
compared favorably to other linear regression methods on synthetic data and
datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.

endomorphism of the free monoid over A, and w is a word over A. The
D0L-sequence generated by (A, f, w) is the sequence of words (w, f(w), f(f(w)),
f(f(f(w))), ...). The corresponding sequence of lengths, that is the function
mapping each non-negative integer n to |f^n(w)|, is called the growth function
of (A, f, w). In 1978, Salomaa and Soittola deduced the following result from
their thorough study of the theory of rational power series: if the
D0L-sequence generated by (A, f, w) is not eventually the empty word then there
exist a non-negative integer d and a real number b greater than or equal to one
such that |f^n(w)| behaves like n^d b^n as n tends to infinity. The aim of the
present paper is to present a short, direct, elementary proof of this theorem.

superlinear preferential attachment: superlinear preference cannot produce
scale-free networks in the thermodynamic limit, but there are superlinearly
growing network models that perfectly match the structure of some real
scale-free networks, such as the Internet. We obtain an analytic solution,
supported by extensive simulations, for the degree distribution in
superlinearly growing networks with arbitrary average degree, and confirm that
in the true thermodynamic limit these networks are indeed degenerate, i.e.,
almost all nodes have low degrees. We then show that superlinear growth has
vast preasymptotic regimes whose depths depend both on the average degree in
the network and on how superlinear the preference kernel is. We demonstrate
that a superlinearly growing network model can reproduce, in its preasymptotic
regime, the structure of a real network, if the model captures some
sufficiently strong structural constraints -- rich-club connectivity, for
example. These findings suggest that real scale-free networks of finite size
may exist in preasymptotic regimes of network evolution processes that lead to
degenerate network formations in the thermodynamic limit.

  Workshop, Porto, Portugal, May 5 - 9, 2008</comments><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</license><abstract>  Wireless communication is susceptible to adversarial eavesdropping due to the
broadcast nature of the wireless medium. In this paper it is shown how
eavesdropping can be alleviated by exploiting the superposition property of the
wireless medium. A wiretap channel with a helping interferer (WT-HI), in which
a transmitter sends a confidential message to its intended receiver in the
presence of a passive eavesdropper, and with the help of an independent
interferer, is considered. The interferer, which does not know the confidential
message, helps in ensuring the secrecy of the message by sending independent
signals. An achievable secrecy rate for the WT-HI is given. The results show
that interference can be exploited to assist secrecy in wireless
communications. An important example of the Gaussian case, in which the
interferer has a better channel to the intended receiver than to the
eavesdropper, is considered. In this situation, the interferer can send a
(random) codeword at a rate that ensures that it can be decoded and subtracted
from the received signal by the intended receiver but cannot be decoded by the
eavesdropper. Hence, only the eavesdropper is interfered with and the secrecy
level of the confidential message is increased.

techniques to discover valuable information from navigation behavior of World
Wide Web users. As in classical data mining, data preparation and pattern
discovery are the main issues in web usage mining. The first phase of web usage
mining is the data processing phase, which includes the session reconstruction
operation from server logs. Session reconstruction success directly affects the
quality of the frequent patterns discovered in the next phase. In reactive web
usage mining techniques, the source data is web server logs and the topology of
the web pages served by the web server domain. Other kinds of information
collected during the interactive browsing of web site by user, such as cookies
or web logs containing similar information, are not used. The next phase of web
usage mining is discovering frequent user navigation patterns. In this phase,
pattern discovery methods are applied on the reconstructed sessions obtained in
the first phase in order to discover frequent user patterns. In this paper, we
propose a frequent web usage pattern discovery method that can be applied after
session reconstruction phase. In order to compare accuracy performance of
session reconstruction phase and pattern discovery phase, we have used an agent
simulator, which models behavior of web users and generates web user navigation
as well as the log data kept by the web server.

approximate Dodgson's and (the ``minimization version'' of) Young's scoring
rules to within a logarithmic factor. Our approximation of Dodgson's rule is
tight up to a constant factor, as Dodgson's rule is $\NP$-hard to approximate
to within some logarithmic factor. The ``maximization version'' of Young's rule
is known to be $\NP$-hard to approximate by any constant factor. Both
approximations are simple, and natural as rules in their own right: Given a
candidate we wish to score, we can regard either its Dodgson or Young score as
the edit distance between a given set of voter preferences and one in which the
candidate to be scored is the Condorcet winner. (The difference between the two
scoring rules is the type of edits allowed.) We regard the marginal cost of a
sequence of edits to be the number of edits divided by the number of reductions
(in the candidate's deficit against any of its opponents in the pairwise race
against that opponent) that the edits yield. Over a series of rounds, our
scoring rules greedily choose a sequence of edits that modify exactly one
voter's preferences and whose marginal cost is no greater than any other such
single-vote-modifying sequence.

programs accounting for their dynamics. The initial presentation, translated as
an algebraic weighting of paths in proofnets, led to a better characterization
of the lambda-calculus optimal reduction. Recently Ehrhard and Regnier have
introduced an extension of the Multiplicative Exponential fragment of Linear
Logic (MELL) that is able to express non-deterministic behaviour of programs
and a proofnet-like calculus: Differential Interaction Nets. This paper
constructs a proper Geometry of Interaction (GoI) for this extension. We
consider it both as an algebraic theory and as a concrete reversible
computation. We draw links between this GoI and the one of MELL. As a
by-product we give for the first time an equational theory suitable for the GoI
of the Multiplicative Additive fragment of Linear Logic.

There is a seriously wrong formula in derivation

  kernel NCA</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This paper focuses on the problem of kernelizing an existing supervised
Mahalanobis distance learner. The following features are included in the paper.
Firstly, three popular learners, namely, &quot;neighborhood component analysis&quot;,
&quot;large margin nearest neighbors&quot; and &quot;discriminant neighborhood embedding&quot;,
which do not have kernel versions are kernelized in order to improve their
classification performances. Secondly, an alternative kernelization framework
called &quot;KPCA trick&quot; is presented. Implementing a learner in the new framework
gains several advantages over the standard framework, e.g. no mathematical
formulas and no reprogramming are required for a kernel implementation, the
framework avoids troublesome problems such as singularity, etc. Thirdly, while
the truths of representer theorems are just assumptions in previous papers
related to ours, here, representer theorems are formally proven. The proofs
validate both the kernel trick and the KPCA trick in the context of Mahalanobis
distance learning. Fourthly, unlike previous works which always apply brute
force methods to select a kernel, we investigate two approaches which can be
efficiently adopted to construct an appropriate kernel for a given dataset.
Finally, numerical results on various real-world datasets are presented.

computer vision community a powerful processing platform. Indeed, a lot of
highly-parallelizable computer vision problems can be significantly accelerated
using GPU architecture. Among these algorithms, the k nearest neighbor search
(KNN) is a well-known problem linked with many applications such as
classification, estimation of statistical properties, etc. The main drawback of
this task lies in its computation burden, as it grows polynomially with the
data size. In this paper, we show that the use of the NVIDIA CUDA API
accelerates the search for the KNN up to a factor of 120.

and estimate a parameter of interest. We are interested in the case where the
temporal process sensed by each sensor can be modeled as a state-space process
that is perturbed by random noise and parametrized by an unknown parameter. To
estimate the unknown parameter from the measurements that the sensors
sequentially collect, we propose a distributed and recursive estimation
algorithm, which we refer to as the incremental recursive prediction error
algorithm. This algorithm has the distributed property of incremental gradient
algorithms and the on-line property of recursive prediction error algorithms.
We study the convergence behavior of the algorithm and provide sufficient
conditions for its convergence. Our convergence result is rather general and
contains as special cases the known convergence results for the incremental
versions of the least-mean square algorithm. Finally, we use the algorithm
developed in this paper to identify the source of a gas-leak (diffusing source)
in a closed warehouse and also report numerical simulations to verify
convergence.

  Primary User CSI</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This paper is concerned with spectrum sharing cognitive radio networks, where
a secondary user (SU) or cognitive radio link communicates simultaneously over
the same frequency band with an existing primary user (PU) link. It is assumed
that the SU transmitter has the perfect channel state information (CSI) on the
fading channels from SU transmitter to both PU and SU receivers (as usually
assumed in the literature), as well as the fading channel from PU transmitter
to PU receiver (a new assumption). With the additional PU CSI, we study the
optimal power control for the SU over different fading states to maximize the
SU ergodic capacity subject to a new proposed constraint to protect the PU
transmission, which limits the maximum ergodic capacity loss of the PU resulted
from the SU transmission. It is shown that the proposed SU power-control policy
is superior over the conventional policy under the constraint on the maximum
tolerable interference power/interperferecne temperature at the PU receiver, in
terms of the achievable ergodic capacities of both PU and SU.

implications of Jensen's inequality, such as the non-negativity of the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Jensen's inequality also underlies the
concept of Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), which is a symmetrized and smoothed
version of the KLD. This paper introduces new JSD-type divergences, by
extending its two building blocks: convexity and Shannon's entropy. In
particular, a new concept of q-convexity is introduced and shown to satisfy a
Jensen's q-inequality. Based on this Jensen's q-inequality, the Jensen-Tsallis
q-difference is built, which is a nonextensive generalization of the JSD, based
on Tsallis entropies. Finally, the Jensen-Tsallis q-difference is charaterized
in terms of convexity and extrema.

Preprint.</comments><acm-class>F.4.1</acm-class><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  LF is a dependent type theory in which many other formal systems can be
conveniently embedded. However, correct use of LF relies on nontrivial
metatheoretic developments such as proofs of correctness of decision procedures
for LF's judgments. Although detailed informal proofs of these properties have
been published, they have not been formally verified in a theorem prover. We
have formalized these properties within Isabelle/HOL using the Nominal Datatype
Package, closely following a recent article by Harper and Pfenning. In the
process, we identified and resolved a gap in one of the proofs and a small
number of minor lacunae in others. We also formally derive a version of the
type checking algorithm from which Isabelle/HOL can generate executable code.
Besides its intrinsic interest, our formalization provides a foundation for
studying the adequacy of LF encodings, the correctness of Twelf-style
metatheoretic reasoning, and the metatheory of extensions to LF.

error correcting codes associated to Grassmann varieties and, more generally,
to Schubert varieties in Grassmannians. The problem is partially solved in the
case of Grassmann codes, and one of the solutions uses the combinatorial notion
of a closed family. We propose a generalization of this to what is called a
subclose family. A number of properties of subclose families are proved, and
its connection with the notion of threshold graphs and graphs with maximum sum
of squares of vertex degrees is outlined.

polynomial decomposition. In this paper we present new counterexamples to
Ritt's first theorem, which states the equality of length of decomposition
chains of a polynomial, in the case of rational functions. Namely, we provide
an explicit example of a rational function with coefficients in Q and two
decompositions of different length.
  Another aspect is the use of some techniques that could allow for other
counterexamples, namely, relating groups and decompositions and using the fact
that the alternating group A_4 has two subgroup chains of different lengths;
and we provide more information about the generalizations of another property
of polynomial decomposition: the stability of the base field. We also present
an algorithm for computing the fixing group of a rational function providing
the complexity over Q.

crosscutting concerns into aspects. Some mechanisms to compose aspects allow
invasiveness as a mean to integrate concerns. Invasiveness means that AOP
languages have unrestricted access to program properties. Such kind of
languages are interesting because they allow performing complex operations and
better introduce functionalities. In this report we present a classification of
invasive patterns in AOP. This classification characterizes the aspects
invasive behavior and allows developers to abstract about the aspect incidence
over the program they crosscut.

Submitted to the 5th International Symposium on

low-density generator-matrix code. We derive two lower bounds on the rate
distortion function which are valid for any low-density generator-matrix code
with a given node degree distribution L(x) on the set of generators and for any
encoding algorithm. These bounds show that, due to the sparseness of the code,
the performance is strictly bounded away from the Shannon rate-distortion
function. In this sense, our bounds represent a natural generalization of
Gallager's bound on the maximum rate at which low-density parity-check codes
can be used for reliable transmission. Our bounds are similar in spirit to the
technique recently developed by Dimakis, Wainwright, and Ramchandran, but they
apply to individual codes.

  Networks</title><categories>cs.DS cs.NI</categories><comments>29 pages</comments><acm-class>F.2</acm-class><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A wireless system with multiple channels is considered, where each channel
has several transmission states. A user learns about the instantaneous state of
an available channel by transmitting a control packet in it. Since probing all
channels consumes significant energy and time, a user needs to determine what
and how much information it needs to acquire about the instantaneous states of
the available channels so that it can maximize its transmission rate. This
motivates the study of the trade-off between the cost of information
acquisition and its value towards improving the transmission rate.
  A simple model is presented for studying this information acquisition and
exploitation trade-off when the channels are multi-state, with different
distributions and information acquisition costs. The objective is to maximize a
utility function which depends on both the cost and value of information.
Solution techniques are presented for computing near-optimal policies with
succinct representation in polynomial time. These policies provably achieve at
least a fixed constant factor of the optimal utility on any problem instance,
and in addition, have natural characterizations. The techniques are based on
exploiting the structure of the optimal policy, and use of Lagrangean
relaxations which simplify the space of approximately optimal solutions.

the outmost general chains of dibicliques denoting thus the outmost general
chains of binary relations. Because of this fact KoDAGs start to become an
outstanding concept of nowadays investigation. We propose here examples of
codings of KoDAGs looked upon as infinite hyper-boxes as well as chains of
rectangular hyper-boxes in N^\infty. Neither of KoDAGs codings considered here
is a poset isomorphism with Pi = &lt;P, \leq&gt;. Nevertheless every example of
coding supplies a new view on possible investigation of KoDAGs properties. The
codes proposed here down are by now recognized as most relevant codes for
practical purposes including visualization. More than that. Employing quite
arbitrary sequences F=\{n_F\}_{n\geq 0} infinitely many new representations of
natural numbers called base of F number system representations are introduced.
These constitute mixed radix-type numeral systems. F base nonstandard
positional numeral systems in which the numerical base varies from position to
position have picturesque interpretation due to KoDAGs graphs and their
correspondent posets which in turn are endowed on their own with combinatorial
interpretation of uniquely assigned to KoDAGs F-nomial coefficients. The base
of F number systems are used for KoDAGs coding and are interpreted as chain
coordinatization in KoDAGs pictures as well as systems of infinite number of
boxes sequences of F-varying containers capacity of subsequent boxes. Needless
to say how crucial is this base of F number system for KoDAGs hence
consequently for arbitrary chains of binary relations. New F based numeral
systems are umbral base of F number systems in a sense to be explained in what
follows.

uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channels that are selective both in time and
frequency, and are underspread, i.e., the product of the channel's delay spread
and Doppler spread is small. For input signals that are peak constrained in
time and frequency, we obtain upper and lower bounds on capacity that are
explicit in the channel's scattering function, are accurate for a large range
of bandwidth and allow to coarsely identify the capacity-optimal bandwidth as a
function of the peak power and the channel's scattering function. We also
obtain a closed-form expression for the first-order Taylor series expansion of
capacity in the limit of large bandwidth, and show that our bounds are tight in
the wideband regime. For input signals that are peak constrained in time only
(and, hence, allowed to be peaky in frequency), we provide upper and lower
bounds on the infinite-bandwidth capacity and find cases when the bounds
coincide and the infinite-bandwidth capacity is characterized exactly. Our
lower bound is closely related to a result by Viterbi (1967).
  The analysis in this paper is based on a discrete-time discrete-frequency
approximation of WSSUS time- and frequency-selective channels. This
discretization explicitly takes into account the underspread property, which is
satisfied by virtually all wireless communication channels.

negative numbers on a linearly ordered set, and we endow this new structure
with a suitable algebra, very close to the ring of real numbers. In a second
step, we introduce the M\&quot;obius transform on this new structure. Lastly, we
define the symmetric Sugeno integral, and show its similarity with the
symmetric Choquet integral.

coding. First, we focus on ST code constructions for the short block-length
case, i.e., when the block-length is equal to or slightly larger than the
number of transmit antennas. We present constructions based on dense lattice
packings and nested lattice (Voronoi) shaping. Our codes achieve the optimal
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of quasi-static MIMO fading channels for any
fading statistics, and perform very well also at practical, moderate values of
signal to noise ratios (SNR). Then, we extend the construction to the case of
large block lengths, by using trellis coset coding. We provide constructions of
trellis coded modulation (TCM) schemes that are endowed with good packing and
shaping properties. Both short-block and trellis constructions allow for a
reduced complexity decoding algorithm based on minimum mean squared error
generalized decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-GDFE) lattice decoding and a
combination of this with a Viterbi TCM decoder for the TCM case. Beyond the
interesting algebraic structure, we exhibit codes whose performance is among
the state-of-the art considering codes with similar encoding/decoding
complexity.

from m random noisy measurements is of interest in many areas such as system
identification, denoising, pattern recognition, and compressed sensing. This
paper addresses the scaling of the number of measurements m, with signal
dimension n and sparsity-level nonzeros k, for asymptotically-reliable
detection. We show a necessary condition for perfect recovery at any given SNR
for all algorithms, regardless of complexity, is m = Omega(k log(n-k))
measurements. Conversely, it is shown that this scaling of Omega(k log(n-k))
measurements is sufficient for a remarkably simple ``maximum correlation''
estimator. Hence this scaling is optimal and does not require more
sophisticated techniques such as lasso or matching pursuit. The constants for
both the necessary and sufficient conditions are precisely defined in terms of
the minimum-to-average ratio of the nonzero components and the SNR. The
necessary condition improves upon previous results for maximum likelihood
estimation. For lasso, it also provides a necessary condition at any SNR and
for low SNR improves upon previous work. The sufficient condition provides the
first asymptotically-reliable detection guarantee at finite SNR.

multiple correlated sources where each terminal wants to losslessly reconstruct
all the sources. We study the inefficiency brought forth by the selfish
behavior of the terminals in this scenario by modeling it as a noncooperative
game among the terminals. The degradation in performance due to the lack of
regulation is measured by the {\it Price of Anarchy} (POA), which is defined as
the ratio between the cost of the worst possible \textit{Wardrop equilibrium}
and the socially optimum cost. Our main result is that in contrast with the
case of independent sources, the presence of source correlations can
significantly increase the price of anarchy. Towards establishing this result,
we first characterize the socially optimal flow and rate allocation in terms of
four intuitive conditions. Next, we show that the Wardrop equilibrium is a
socially optimal solution for a different set of (related) cost functions.
Using this, we construct explicit examples that demonstrate that the POA $&gt; 1$
and determine near-tight upper bounds on the POA as well. The main techniques
in our analysis are Lagrangian duality theory and the usage of the
supermodularity of conditional entropy.

to values, in the spirit of Bloom Filters. The space requirements of the
dictionary we suggest are much smaller than those of a hashtable. We allow
storing n keys, each mapped to value which is a string of k bits. Our suggested
method requires nk + o(n) bits space to store the dictionary, and O(n) time to
produce the data structure, and allows answering a membership query in O(1)
memory probes. The dictionary size does not depend on the size of the keys.
However, reducing the space requirements of the data structure comes at a
certain cost. Our dictionary has a small probability of a one sided error. When
attempting to obtain the value for a key that is stored in the dictionary we
always get the correct answer. However, when testing for membership of an
element that is not stored in the dictionary, we may get an incorrect answer,
and when requesting the value of such an element we may get a certain random
value. Our method is based on solving equations in GF(2^k) and using several
hash functions. Another significant advantage of our suggested method is that
we do not require using sophisticated hash functions. We only require pairwise
independent hash functions. We also suggest a data structure that requires only
nk bits space, has O(n2) preprocessing time, and has a O(log n) query time.
However, this data structures requires a uniform hash functions. In order
replace a Bloom Filter of n elements with an error proability of 2^{-k}, we
require nk + o(n) memory bits, O(1) query time, O(n) preprocessing time, and
only pairwise independent hash function. Even the most advanced previously
known Bloom Filter would require nk+O(n) space, and a uniform hash functions,
so our method is significantly less space consuming especially when k is small.

which quantum systems can be manipulated in a controlled and coherent way. One
of the most important goals now is to build quantum simulators, which would
open up the possibility of exciting experiments probing various theories in
regimes that are not achievable under normal lab circumstances. Here we present
a novel approach to gain detailed control on the quantum simulation of strongly
correlated quantum many-body systems by constructing the explicit quantum
circuits that diagonalize their dynamics. We show that the exact quantum
circuits underlying some of the most relevant many-body Hamiltonians only need
a finite amount of local gates. As a particularly simple instance, the full
dynamics of a one-dimensional Quantum Ising model in a transverse field with
four spins is shown to be reproduced using a quantum circuit of only six local
gates. This opens up the possibility of experimentally producing strongly
correlated states, their time evolution at zero time and even thermal
superpositions at zero temperature. Our method also allows to uncover the exact
circuits corresponding to models that exhibit topological order and to
stabilizer states.

  and Distributed Systems</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Unlike traditional routing procedures that, at the best, single out a unique
route, multi-path routing protocols discover proactively several alternative
routes. It has been recognized that multi-path routing can be more efficient
than traditional one mainly for mobile ad hoc networks, where route failure
events are frequent. Most studies in the area of multi-path routing focus on
heuristic methods, and the performances of these strategies are commonly
evaluated by numerical simulations. The need of a theoretical analysis
motivates such a paper, which proposes to resort to the terminal-pair routing
reliability as performance metric. This metric allows one to assess the
performance gain due to the availability of route diversity. By resorting to
graph theory, we propose an analytical framework to evaluate the tolerance of
multi-path route discovery processes against route failures for mobile ad hoc
networks. Moreover, we derive a useful bound to easily estimate the performance
improvements achieved by multi-path routing with respect to any traditional
routing protocol. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness
of this performance analysis.

non-additive measures (or capacities) as the Choquet and the \Sipos{} integral,
and the multilinear model, all seen as extensions of pseudo-Boolean functions,
and used as a means to model interaction between criteria in a multicriteria
decision making problem. The emphasis is put on the use, besides classical
comparative information, of information about difference of attractiveness
between acts, and on the existence, for each point of view, of a ``neutral
level'', allowing to introduce the absolute notion of attractive or repulsive
act. It is shown that in this case, the Sipos integral is a suitable solution,
although not unique. Properties of the Sipos integral as a new way of
aggregating criteria are shown, with emphasis on the interaction among
criteria.

We first discuss different techniques to collect user traces and then focus on
results obtained using a crawler that we built. Tempted by the question whether
our methodology could provide similar results to those obtained in real-world
experiments, we study the statistical distribution of user contacts and show
that from a qualitative point of view user mobility in Second Life presents
similar traits to those of real humans. We further push our analysis to line of
sight networks that emerge from user interaction and show that they are highly
clustered. Lastly, we focus on the spatial properties of user movements and
observe that users in Second Life revolve around several point of interests
traveling in general short distances. Besides our findings, the traces
collected in this work can be very useful for trace-driven simulations of
communication schemes in delay tolerant networks and their performance
evaluation.

of graph invariants that contain combinatorial invariants such as the number of
k-colourings or the number of independent sets of a graph and also the
partition functions of certain &quot;spin glass&quot; models of statistical physics such
as the Ising model.
  Building on earlier work by Dyer, Greenhill and Bulatov, Grohe, we completely
classify the computational complexity of partition functions. Our main result
is a dichotomy theorem stating that every partition function is either
computable in polynomial time or #P-complete. Partition functions are described
by symmetric matrices with real entries, and we prove that it is decidable in
polynomial time in terms of the matrix whether a given partition function is in
polynomial time or #P-complete.
  While in general it is very complicated to give an explicit algebraic or
combinatorial description of the tractable cases, for partition functions
described by a Hadamard matrices -- these turn out to be central in our proofs
-- we obtain a simple algebraic tractability criterion, which says that the
tractable cases are those &quot;representable&quot; by a quadratic polynomial over the
field GF(2).

topological invariants such as the genus and homology groups in 3D. These
properties can be used to identify patterns in 3D image recognition. This has
tremendous amount of applications in 3D medical image analysis. Our method is
based on cubical images with direct adjacency, also called (6,26)-connectivity
images in discrete geometry. According to the fact that there are only six
types of local surface points in 3D and a discrete version of the well-known
Gauss-Bonnett Theorem in differential geometry, we first determine the genus of
a closed 2D-connected component (a closed digital surface). Then, we use
Alexander duality to obtain the homology groups of a 3D object in 3D space.

arcs directed outwards from the root. An out-branching is a spanning out-tree.
By $l(D)$ and $l_s(D)$ we denote the maximum number of leaves over all
out-trees and out-branchings of $D$, respectively.
  We give fixed parameter tractable algorithms for deciding whether $l_s(D)\geq
k$ and whether $l(D)\geq k$ for a digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices, both with time
complexity $2^{O(k\log k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$. This improves on previous
algorithms with complexity $2^{O(k^3\log k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ and $2^{O(k\log^2
k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, respectively.
  To obtain the complexity bound in the case of out-branchings, we prove that
when all arcs of $D$ are part of at least one out-branching, $l_s(D)\geq
l(D)/3$. The second bound we prove in this paper states that for strongly
connected digraphs $D$ with minimum in-degree 3, $l_s(D)\geq \Theta(\sqrt{n})$,
where previously $l_s(D)\geq \Theta(\sqrt[3]{n})$ was the best known bound.
This bound is tight, and also holds for the larger class of digraphs with
minimum in-degree 3 in which every arc is part of at least one out-branching.

digital electrical engineering. An asynchronous system f is a multi-valued
function that assigns to each admissible input u a set f(u) of possible states
x in f(u). A special case of asynchronous system consists in the existence of a
Boolean function \Upsilon such that for any u and any x in f(u), a certain
equation involving \Upsilon is fulfilled. Then \Upsilon is called the generator
function of f (Moisil used the terminology of network function) and we say that
f is generated by \Upsilon. The systems that have a generator function are
called regular.
  Our purpose is to continue the study of the generation of the asynchronous
systems that was started in [2], [3].

information retrieval systems. In this work we have tested different approaches
to extract the candidate query terms from the top ranked documents returned by
the first-pass retrieval.
  One of them is the cooccurrence approach, based on measures of cooccurrence
of the candidate and the query terms in the retrieved documents. The other one,
the probabilistic approach, is based on the probability distribution of terms
in the collection and in the top ranked set.
  We compare the retrieval improvement achieved by expanding the query with
terms obtained with different methods belonging to both approaches. Besides, we
have developed a na\&quot;ive combination of both kinds of method, with which we
have obtained results that improve those obtained with any of them separately.
This result confirms that the information provided by each approach is of a
different nature and, therefore, can be used in a combined manner.

network coding (PNC) - is a promising technique for two-way relay wireless
networks. In a two-way relay network, relay nodes are used to relay two-way
information flows between pairs of end nodes. This paper proposes a precise
definition for PNC. Specifically, in PNC, a relay node does not decode the
source information from the two ends separately, but rather directly maps the
combined signals received simultaneously to a signal to be relayed. Based on
this definition, PNC can be further sub-classed into two categories - PNCF (PNC
over finite field) and PNCI (PNC over infinite field) - according to whether
the network-code field (or groups, rings) adopted is finite or infinite. For
each of PNCF and PNCI, we consider two specific estimation techniques for
dealing with noise in the mapping process. The performance of the four schemes
is investigated by means of analysis and simulation, assuming symbol-level
synchronization only.

Prolog's fast unification algorithm and built-in backtracking mechanism,
efficiency of our search algorithm is ensured by using parallel bitstring
operations together with logic variable equality propagation, as a mapping
mechanism from primary inputs to the leaves of candidate Leaf-DAGs implementing
a combinational circuit specification. After an exhaustive expressiveness
comparison of various minimal libraries, a surprising first-runner, Strict
Boolean Inequality &quot;&lt;&quot; together with constant function &quot;1&quot; also turns out to
have small transistor-count implementations, competitive to NAND-only or
NOR-only libraries. As a practical outcome, a more realistic circuit
synthesizer is implemented that combines rewriting-based simplification of

incentives of self-interested agents with the objectives of a system designer.
There is, however, a fundamental disconnect between the traditional application
domains of mechanism design (such as auctions) and those arising in computer
science (such as networks): while monetary transfers (i.e., payments) are
essential for most of the known positive results in mechanism design, they are
undesirable or even technologically infeasible in many computer systems.
Classical impossibility results imply that the reach of mechanisms without
transfers is severely limited.
  Computer systems typically do have the ability to reduce service
quality--routing systems can drop or delay traffic, scheduling protocols can
delay the release of jobs, and computational payment schemes can require
computational payments from users (e.g., in spam-fighting systems). Service
degradation is tantamount to requiring that users burn money}, and such
``payments'' can be used to influence the preferences of the agents at a cost
of degrading the social surplus.
  We develop a framework for the design and analysis of money-burning
mechanisms to maximize the residual surplus--the total value of the chosen
outcome minus the payments required.

flow problem in a game theoretic setting. In this setting, there are selfish
agents, which control some of the requests characteristics, and may be
dishonest about them. It is worth noting that in game theoretic settings many
standard techniques, such as randomized rounding, violate certain monotonicity
properties, which are imperative for truthfulness, and therefore cannot be
employed. In light of this state of affairs, we design a monotone deterministic
algorithm, which is based on a primal-dual machinery, which attains an
approximation ratio of $\frac{e}{e-1}$, up to a disparity of $\epsilon$ away.
This implies an improvement on the current best truthful mechanism, as well as
an improvement on the current best combinatorial algorithm for the problem
under consideration. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that any algorithm in the
family of reasonable iterative path minimizing algorithms, cannot yield a
better approximation ratio. Consequently, it follows that in order to achieve a
monotone PTAS, if exists, one would have to exert different techniques. We also
consider the large capacities \textit{single-minded multi-unit combinatorial
auction problem}. This problem is closely related to the unsplittable flow
problem since one can formulate it as a special case of the integer linear
program of the unsplittable flow problem. Accordingly, we obtain a comparable
performance guarantee by refining the algorithm suggested for the unsplittable
flow problem.

have now been also routinely used in speech recognition, processing of natural
languages, images, and in bioinformatics. In an HMM $(X_i,Y_i)_{i\ge 1}$,
observations $X_1,X_2,...$ are assumed to be conditionally independent given an
``explanatory'' Markov process $Y_1,Y_2,...$, which itself is not observed;
moreover, the conditional distribution of $X_i$ depends solely on $Y_i$.
Central to the theory and applications of HMM is the Viterbi algorithm to find
{\em a maximum a posteriori} (MAP) estimate $q_{1:n}=(q_1,q_2,...,q_n)$ of
$Y_{1:n}$ given observed data $x_{1:n}$. Maximum {\em a posteriori} paths are
also known as Viterbi paths or alignments. Recently, attempts have been made to
study the behavior of Viterbi alignments when $n\to \infty$. Thus, it has been
shown that in some special cases a well-defined limiting Viterbi alignment
exists. While innovative, these attempts have relied on rather strong
assumptions and involved proofs which are existential. This work proves the
existence of infinite Viterbi alignments in a more constructive manner and for
a very general class of HMMs.

are computationally equivalent problems. In positive characteristic, we show
that differential operators can be multiplied in nearly optimal time.
Theoretical results are validated by intensive experiments.

antenna (MEA) channels is analyzed in terms of the diversity-multiplexing
tradeoff (DMT) at finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. A lower bound on
the outage probability is first derived. Using this bound accurate finite-SNR
estimate of the DMT is then derived. This estimate allows to gain insight on
the impact of spatial correlation on the DMT at finite SNR. As expected, the
DMT is severely degraded as the spatial correlation increases. Moreover, using
asymptotic analysis, we show that our framework encompasses well-known results
concerning the asymptotic behavior of the DMT.

  http://www.dsi.uniroma1.it/~novella/mobile_sensors/</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Mobile sensor networks are important for several strategic applications
devoted to monitoring critical areas. In such hostile scenarios, sensors cannot
be deployed manually and are either sent from a safe location or dropped from
an aircraft. Mobile devices permit a dynamic deployment reconfiguration that
improves the coverage in terms of completeness and uniformity.
  In this paper we propose a distributed algorithm for the autonomous
deployment of mobile sensors called Push&amp;Pull. According to our proposal,
movement decisions are made by each sensor on the basis of locally available
information and do not require any prior knowledge of the operating conditions
or any manual tuning of key parameters.
  We formally prove that, when a sufficient number of sensors are available,
our approach guarantees a complete and uniform coverage. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the algorithm execution always terminates preventing movement
oscillations.
  Numerous simulations show that our algorithm reaches a complete coverage
within reasonable time with moderate energy consumption, even when the target
area has irregular shapes. Performance comparisons between Push&amp;Pull and one of
the most acknowledged algorithms show how the former one can efficiently reach
a more uniform and complete coverage under a wide range of working scenarios.

introduced and studied. The graph represents a wireless network and includes
only edges over which secure communication in the presence of eavesdroppers is
possible. The underlying point process models considered are lattices and
Poisson point processes. In the lattice case, analogies to standard bond and
site percolation can be exploited to determine percolation thresholds. In the
Poisson case, the node degrees are determined and percolation is studied using
analytical bounds and simulations. It turns out that a small density of
eavesdroppers already has a drastic impact on the connectivity of the secrecy
graph.

repository-centric notion of digital object to a bounded aggregation of Web
resources. In this manner, digital library content is more integrated with the
Web architecture, and thereby more accessible to Web applications and clients.
This generalized notion of an aggregation that is independent of repository
containment conforms more closely with notions in eScience and eScholarship,
where content is distributed across multiple services and databases. We provide
a motivation for the OAI-ORE project, review previous interoperability efforts,
describe draft ORE specifications and report on promising results from early
experimentation that illustrate improved interoperability and reuse of digital
objects.

where traders bet on the final ranking of n candidates. We present a
Proportional Betting mechanism for this market. Our mechanism allows the
traders to bet on any subset of the n x n 'candidate-rank' pairs, and rewards
them proportionally to the number of pairs that appear in the final outcome. We
show that market organizer's decision problem for this mechanism can be
formulated as a convex program of polynomial size. More importantly, the
formulation yields a set of n x n unique marginal prices that are sufficient to
price the bets in this mechanism, and are computable in polynomial-time. The
marginal prices reflect the traders' beliefs about the marginal distributions
over outcomes. We also propose techniques to compute the joint distribution
over n! permutations from these marginal distributions. We show that using a
maximum entropy criterion, we can obtain a concise parametric form (with only n
x n parameters) for the joint distribution which is defined over an
exponentially large state space. We then present an approximation algorithm for
computing the parameters of this distribution. In fact, the algorithm addresses
the generic problem of finding the maximum entropy distribution over
permutations that has a given mean, and may be of independent interest.

nine-neighborhood, null- boundary, uniform as well as hybrid Cellular Automata
(2D CA) linear rules in image processing. These rules are classified into nine
groups depending upon the number of neighboring cells influences the cell under
consideration. All the Uniform rules have been found to be rendering multiple
copies of a given image depending on the groups to which they belong where as
Hybrid rules are also shown to be characterizing the phenomena of zooming in,
zooming out, thickening and thinning of a given image. Further, using hybrid CA
rules a new searching algorithm is developed called Sweepers algorithm which is
found to be applicable to simulate many inter disciplinary research areas like
migration of organisms towards a single point destination, Single Attractor and
Multiple Attractor Cellular Automata Theory, Pattern Classification and
Clustering Problem, Image compression, Encryption and Decryption problems,
Density Classification problem etc.

the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election
process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote
voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account
susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most
the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site
electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they
cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform
problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.
This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic
encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques
recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol
tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible
for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper
ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations
(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,
is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme
is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the
server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the
voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.

an analysis of the content of text documents. The Wikipedia index database is
created and used to automatically generate the user profile from the user
document collection. The problem-oriented Wikipedia subcorpora are created
(using knowledge extracted from the user profile) for each topic of user
interests. The index databases of these subcorpora are applied to filtering
information flow (e.g., mails, news). Thus, the analyzed texts are classified
into several topics explicitly presented in the user profile. The paper
concentrates on the indexing part of the approach. The architecture of an
application implementing the Wikipedia indexing is described. The indexing
method is evaluated using the Russian and Simple English Wikipedia.

of the dependencies embedded in probabilistic models. It is well known that
independencies captured by Markov networks (called graph-isomorphs) have a
finite axiomatic characterization. This paper, however, shows that
independencies captured by Bayesian networks (called causal models) have no
axiomatization by using even countably many Horn or disjunctive clauses. This
is because a sub-independency model of a causal model may be not causal, while
graph-isomorphs are closed under sub-models.

properties in multi-agents systems. It allows to reason on the existence of
strategies for coalitions of agents in order to enforce a given property. In
this paper, we first precisely characterize the complexity of ATL
model-checking over Alternating Transition Systems and Concurrent Game
Structures when the number of agents is not fixed. We prove that it is
\Delta^P_2 - and \Delta^P_?_3-complete, depending on the underlying multi-agent
model (ATS and CGS resp.). We also consider the same problems for some
extensions of ATL. We then consider expressiveness issues. We show how ATS and
CGS are related and provide translations between these models w.r.t.
alternating bisimulation. We also prove that the standard definition of ATL
(built on modalities &quot;Next&quot;, &quot;Always&quot; and &quot;Until&quot;) cannot express the duals of
its modalities: it is necessary to explicitely add the modality &quot;Release&quot;.

sources which lacks a closed formula even for subclasses of sources which have
intuitive parameterizations. A good way to overcome this problem is to examine
its analytic properties relative to some reasonable topology. A canonical
choice of a topology is that of the norm of total variation as it immediately
arises with the idea of a discrete random source as a probability measure on
sequence space. It is shown that entropy rate is Lipschitzian relative to this
topology, which, by well known facts, is close to differentiability. An
application of this theorem leads to a simple and elementary proof of the
existence of entropy rate of random sources with finite evolution dimension.
This class of sources encompasses arbitrary hidden Markov sources and quantum
random walks.

  April 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We consider the design of multiple-input multiple-output communication
systems with a linear precoder at the transmitter, zero-forcing decision
feedback equalization (ZF-DFE) at the receiver, and a low-rate feedback channel
that enables communication from the receiver to the transmitter. The channel
state information (CSI) available at the receiver is assumed to be perfect, and
based on this information the receiver selects a suitable precoder from a
codebook and feeds back the index of this precoder to the transmitter. Our
approach to the design of the components of this limited feedback scheme is
based on the development, herein, of a unified framework for the joint design
of the precoder and the ZF-DFE under the assumption that perfect CSI is
available at both the transmitter and the receiver. The framework is general
and embraces a wide range of design criteria. This framework enables us to
characterize the statistical distribution of the optimal precoder in a standard
Rayleigh fading environment. Using this distribution, we show that codebooks
constructed from Grassmann packings minimize an upper bound on an average
distortion measure, and hence are natural candidates for the codebook in
limited feedback systems. We also show that for any given codebook the
performance of the proposed limited feedback schemes is an upper bound on the
corresponding schemes with linear zero-forcing receivers. Our simulation
studies show that the proposed limited feedback scheme can provide
significantly better performance at a lower feedback rate than existing schemes
in which the detection order is fed back to the transmitter.

mean stationarity generalizes the definition of stationarity and covers a much

It is sketched how to obtain source coding and related theorems for arbitrary,

It encodes many properties of the orbit of a graph under edge local
complementation (ELC). The interlace polynomial Q, introduced by Aigner and van
der Holst, similarly contains information about the orbit of a graph under
local complementation (LC). We have previously classified LC and ELC orbits,
and now give an enumeration of the corresponding interlace polynomials of all
graphs of order up to 12. An enumeration of all circle graphs of order up to 12
is also given. We show that there exist graphs of all orders greater than 9
with interlace polynomials q whose coefficient sequences are non-unimodal,
thereby disproving a conjecture by Arratia et al. We have verified that for
graphs of order up to 12, all polynomials Q have unimodal coefficients. It has
been shown that LC and ELC orbits of graphs correspond to equivalence classes
of certain error-correcting codes and quantum states. We show that the
properties of these codes and quantum states are related to properties of the
associated interlace polynomials.

the mere information sharing) in online environments is the disruptive force
upon which phenomena ascribed to the Web2.0 paradigm continuously bud. People
interacting in online socio-technical environments mould technology on their
needs, seamlessly integrating it into their everyday life. MUVEs (Multi User
Virtual Environments) are no exception and, in several cases, represent the new
frontier in this field. In this work we analyze if and how MUVEs can be
considered a mean for augmenting communities (and more in general people) life.
We trace a framework of analysis based on four main observations, and through
these lenses we look at Second Life and at several projects we are currently
developing in that synthetic world.

international accredited master program that has been initiated in 2004 and
started in September 2005. MICS is a research-oriented academic study of 4
semesters and a continuation of the Bachelor towards the PhD. It is completely
taught in English, supported by lecturers coming from more than ten different
countries. This report compass a description of its underlying architecture,
describes some implementation details and gives a presentation of diverse
experiences and results. As the program has been designed and implemented right
after the creation of the University, the significance of the program is
moreover a self-discovery of the computer science department, which has finally
led to the creation of the today's research institutes and research axes.

satisfiability proposed by Sergey Gubin. Gubin introduces the algorithm using
3-SAT and eventually expands it to accept a broad range of forms of the Boolean
satisfiability problem. Because 3-SAT is NP-complete, the algorithm would have
implied P = NP, had it been correct. Additionally, this paper refutes the
correctness of his polynomial-time reduction of SAT to 2-SAT.

process. Recent progress in information management focuses on building
e-infrastructures for the optimization of the research workflow, through both
policy-driven and user-pulled dynamics. For decades, High-Energy Physics (HEP)
has pioneered innovative solutions in the field of information management and
dissemination. In light of a transforming information environment, it is
important to assess the current usage of information resources by researchers
and HEP provides a unique test-bed for this assessment. A survey of about 10%
of practitioners in the field reveals usage trends and information needs.
Community-based services, such as the pioneering arXiv and SPIRES systems,
largely answer the need of the scientists, with a limited but increasing
fraction of younger users relying on Google. Commercial services offered by
publishers or database vendors are essentially unused in the field. The survey
offers an insight into the most important features that users require to
optimize their research workflow. These results inform the future evolution of
information management in HEP and, as these researchers are traditionally
``early adopters'' of innovation in scholarly communication, can inspire
developments of disciplinary repositories serving other communities.

Some of the results appeared in STACS 2006</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  It is well known that modal satisfiability is PSPACE-complete (Ladner 1977).
However, the complexity may decrease if we restrict the set of propositional
operators used. Note that there exist an infinite number of propositional
operators, since a propositional operator is simply a Boolean function. We
completely classify the complexity of modal satisfiability for every finite set
of propositional operators, i.e., in contrast to previous work, we classify an
infinite number of problems. We show that, depending on the set of
propositional operators, modal satisfiability is PSPACE-complete,
coNP-complete, or in P. We obtain this trichotomy not only for modal formulas,
but also for their more succinct representation using modal circuits. We
consider both the uni-modal and the multi-modal case, and study the dual
problem of validity as well.

downlink of a multiuser MISO (multiple-input single-output) communication
system in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). The base
station is equipped with multiple transmit antennas and each user terminal is
equipped with a single receive antenna. We propose a robust design of linear
precoder which transmits minimum power to provide the required SINR at the user
terminals when the true channel state lies in a region of a given size around
the channel state available at the transmitter. We show that this design
problem can be formulated as a Second Order Cone Program (SOCP) which can be
solved efficiently. We compare the performance of the proposed design with some
of the robust designs reported in the literature. Simulation results show that
the proposed robust design provides better performance with reduced complexity.

parsimonious linear interpolator between vertices of $[0,1]^n$. We take this
basic fact as a starting point to define the Choquet integral in a very general
way, using the geometric realization of lattices and their natural
triangulation, as in the work of Koshevoy. A second aim of the paper is to
define a general mechanism for the bipolarization of ordered structures. Bisets
(or signed sets), as well as bisubmodular functions, bicapacities,
bicooperative games, as well as the Choquet integral defined for them can be
seen as particular instances of this scheme. Lastly, an application to
multicriteria aggregation with multiple reference levels illustrates all the
results presented in the paper.

community-based models of the organization from both a theoretical and an
empirical perspective. From a theoretical standpoint, we look at Communities of
Practice (CoPs) and Knowledge Management (KM) and explore the links between the
two as they relate to the use of information systems to manage knowledge. We
begin by reviewing technologically supported approaches to KM and introduce the
idea of &quot;Systemes d'Aide a la Gestion des Connaissances&quot; SAGC (Systems to aid
the Management of Knowledge). Following this we examine the contribution that
communal structures such as CoPs can make to intraorganizational KM and
highlight some of 'success factors' for this approach to KM that are found in
the literature. From an empirical standpoint, we present the results of a
survey involving the Chief Knowledge Officers (CKOs) of twelve large French
businesses; the objective of this study was to identify the factors that might
influence the success of such approaches. The survey was analysed using
thematic content analysis and the results are presented here with some short
illustrative quotes from the CKOs. Finally, the paper concludes with some brief
reflections on what can be learnt from looking at this problem from these two
perspectives.

in businesses and other organisations. This paper seeks to contribute to this
debate by exploring the concept of appropriation from a number of different
epistemological, cultural and linguistic viewpoints to allow us to explore 'the
black box' of appropriation and to gain a fuller understanding of the term. At
the conceptual level, it will examine some of the different ways in which
people have attempted to explain the relationship between the objective and
concrete features of technology and the subjective and shifting nature of the
people and organisation within which that technology is deployed. At the
cultural and linguistic level the paper will examine the notion as it is found
in the Francophone literature, where the term has a long and rich history, and
the Anglophone literature where appropriation is seen as a rather more
specialist term. The paper will conclude with some observations on the ongoing
nature of the debate, the value of reading beyond the literature with which one
is familiar and the rewards that come from exploring different historical (and
linguistic) viewpoints.

Communities of Practice (CoPs) inside electronic networks, and then using this
knowledge to nurture them into a fully developed Virtual Community of Practice
(VCoP). Starting from the standpoint of the need to manage knowledge, it
discusses several questions related to this subject: the characteristics of
'hidden' communities; the relation between CoPs, Virtual Communities (VCs),
Distributed Communities of Practice (DCoPs) and Virtual Communities of Practice
(VCoPs); the methods used to search for 'hidden' CoPs; and the possible ways of
changing 'hidden' CoPs into fully developed VCoPs. The paper also presents some
preliminary findings from a semi-structured interview conducted in The Higher
Education Academy Psychology Network (UK). These findings are contrasted
against the theory discussed and some additional proposals are suggested at the
end.

much lamented, few researchers have offered a way forward except through a
number of (failed) attempts to develop a single systematic theory for
Information Systems. In this paper, we encourage researchers to re-examine the
practical consequences of their theoretical arguments. By examining these
arguments we may be able to form a number of more rigorous theories of
Information Systems, allowing us to draw theory and practice together without
undertaking yet another attempt at the holy grail of a single unified
systematic theory of Information Systems.

three independent memoryless Gaussian channels respectively. Then Alice and Bob
generate a common secret key from their received signals. In this model, we
propose a protocol for generating a common secret key by using the result of
soft-decision of Alice and Bob's received signals. Then, we calculate a lower
bound on the secret key rate in our proposed protocol. As a result of
comparison with the protocol that only uses hard-decision, we found that the
higher rate is obtained by using our protocol.

algorithm employing an adaptive amount of parity bits for error protection. It
is a modified version of error resilient algorithm LZRS'77, proposed recently,
which uses a constant amount of parity over all of the encoded blocks of data.
The constant amount of parity is bounded by the lowest-redundancy part of the
encoded string, whereas the adaptive parity more efficiently utilizes the
available redundancy of the encoded string, and can be on average much higher.
The proposed algorithm thus provides better error protection of encoded data.
  The performance of both algorithms was measured. The comparison showed a
noticeable improvement by use of adaptive parity. The proposed algorithm is
capable of correcting up to a few times as many errors as the original
algorithm, while the compression performance remains practically unchanged.

In this
paper, we propose new sensing methods based on the eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix of signals received at the secondary users. In particular,
two sensing algorithms are suggested, one is based on the ratio of the maximum
eigenvalue to minimum eigenvalue; the other is based on the ratio of the
average eigenvalue to minimum eigenvalue. Using some latest random matrix
theories (RMT), we quantify the distributions of these ratios and derive the
probabilities of false alarm and probabilities of detection for the proposed
algorithms. We also find the thresholds of the methods for a given probability
of false alarm. The proposed methods overcome the noise uncertainty problem,
and can even perform better than the ideal energy detection when the signals to
be detected are highly correlated. The methods can be used for various signal
detection applications without requiring the knowledge of signal, channel and
noise power. Simulations based on randomly generated signals, wireless
microphone signals and captured ATSC DTV signals are presented to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.

codes, under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, are capable of tightly
approaching the performance of an ideal maximum-distance-separable code on the
binary erasure channel. Such result is achievable down to low error rates, even
for small and moderate block sizes, while keeping the decoding complexity low,
thanks to a class of decoding algorithms which exploits the sparseness of the
parity-check matrix to reduce the complexity of Gaussian elimination (GE). In
this paper the main concepts underlying ML decoding of LDPC codes are recalled.
A performance analysis among various LDPC code classes is then carried out,
including a comparison with fixed-rate Raptor codes. The results show that LDPC
and Raptor codes provide almost identical performance in terms of decoding
failure probability vs. overhead.

networks based on the Alamouti space time code and orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing to combat the effect of timing errors at the relay nodes.
This transmission scheme is amazingly simple and achieves a diversity order of
two for any number of relays. Motivated by its simplicity, this scheme is
extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full
cooperative diversity for any number of relays. The conditions on the
distributed space time block code (DSTBC) structure that admit its application
in the proposed transmission scheme are identified and it is pointed out that
the recently proposed full diversity four group decodable DSTBCs from precoded
co-ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs and extended Clifford algebras
satisfy these conditions. It is then shown how differential encoding at the
source can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme to arrive at a new
transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity in asynchronous
wireless relay networks with no channel information and also no timing error
knowledge at the destination node. Finally, four group decodable distributed
differential space time block codes applicable in this new transmission scheme
for power of two number of relays are also provided.

optimistic replication algorithms based on Operational Transformation (OT)
approach used for supporting collaborative edition. We formally define, using
tool UPPAAL, the behavior and the main consistency requirement (i.e.
convergence property) of the collaborative editing systems, as well as the
abstract behavior of the environment where these systems are supposed to
operate. Due to data replication and the unpredictable nature of user
interactions, such systems have infinitely many states. So, we show how to
exploit some features of the UPPAAL specification language to attenuate the
severe state explosion problem. Two models are proposed. The first one, called
concrete model, is very close to the system implementation but runs up against
a severe explosion of states. The second model, called symbolic model, aims to
overcome the limitation of the concrete model by delaying the effective
selection and execution of editing operations until the construction of
symbolic execution traces of all sites is completed. Experimental results have
shown that the symbolic model allows a significant gain in both space and time.
Using the symbolic model, we have been able to show that if the number of sites
exceeds 2 then the convergence property is not satisfied for all OT algorithms
considered here. A counterexample is provided for every algorithm.

  trees</title><categories>cs.DS cs.CC</categories><comments>19 pages, 1 Figure</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We revisit the issue of low-distortion embedding of metric spaces into the
line, and more generally, into the shortest path metric of trees, from the
parameterized complexity perspective.Let $M=M(G)$ be the shortest path metric
of an edge weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ on $n$ vertices. We describe algorithms for
the problem of finding a low distortion non-contracting embedding of $M$ into
line and tree metrics.
  We give an $O(nd^4(2d+1)^{2d})$ time algorithm that for an unweighted graph
metric $M$ and integer $d$ either constructs an embedding of $M$ into the line
with distortion at most $d$, or concludes that no such embedding exists. We
find the result surprising, because the considered problem bears a strong
resemblance to the notoriously hard Bandwidth Minimization problem which does
not admit any FPT algorithm unless an unlikely collapse of parameterized
complexity classes occurs.
  We show that our algorithm can also be applied to construct small distortion
embeddings of weighted graph metrics. The running time of our algorithm is
$O(n(dW)^4(2d+1)^{2dW})$ where $W$ is the largest edge weight of the input
graph. We also show that deciding whether a weighted graph metric $M(G)$ with
maximum weight $W &lt; |V(G)|$ can be embedded into the line with distortion at
most $d$ is NP-Complete for every fixed rational $d \geq 2$. This rules out any
possibility of an algorithm with running time $O((nW)^{h(d)})$ where $h$ is a
function of $d$ alone.
  We generalize the result on embedding into the line by proving that for any
tree $T$ with maximum degree $\Delta$, embedding of $M$ into a shortest path
metric of $T$ is FPT, parameterized by $(\Delta,d)$.

both pushdown (word) automata and the tree automata with constraints of
equality between brothers of Bogaert and Tison. Though it has a decidable
emptiness problem, the main weakness of this model is its lack of good closure
properties.
  We propose a generalization of the visibly pushdown automata of Alur and
Madhusudan to a family of tree recognizers which carry along their (bottom-up)
computation an auxiliary unbounded memory with a tree structure (instead of a
symbol stack). In other words, these recognizers, called Visibly Tree Automata
with Memory (VTAM) define a subclass of tree automata with one memory enjoying
Boolean closure properties. We show in particular that they can be determinized
and the problems like emptiness, membership, inclusion and universality are
decidable for VTAM. Moreover, we propose several extensions of VTAM whose
transitions may be constrained by different kinds of tests between memories and
also constraints a la Bogaert and Tison comparing brother subtrees in the tree
in input. We show that some of these classes of constrained VTAM keep the good
closure and decidability properties, and we demonstrate their expressiveness
with relevant examples of tree languages.

a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system. They appear to be ideally suited
for this since the cross-correlation of d-sequences taken over the LCM of their
periods is zero. But a practical system will not, in most likelihood, satisfy
the condition that the number of chips per bit is equal to the LCM for all
sequences that are assigned to different users. It is essential, therefore, to
determine the partial cross-correlation properties of d-sequences. This paper
has performed experiments on d-sequences and found that the partial
cross-correlation is less than for PN sequences, indicating that d-sequences
can be effective for use in CDMA.

which two end nodes exchange information via a relay node. The capacity is
defined in the information-theoretic sense as the maximum information exchange
rate between the two end nodes. We give an upper bound of the capacity by
applying the cut-set theorem. We prove that this upper bound can be approached
in low SNR region using &quot;separated&quot; multiple access for uplinks from the end
nodes to the relay in which the data from the end nodes are individually
decoded at the relay; and network-coding broadcast for downlinks from the relay
to the end nodes in which the relay mixes the information from end nodes before
forwarding. We further prove that the capacity is approachable in high SNR
region using physical-layer network coding (PNC) multiple access for uplinks,
and network-coding broadcast for downlinks. From our proof and observations, we
conjecture that the upper bound may be achieved with PNC in all SNR regions.

Dayal-Brehler-Varanasi have proved that training codes achieve the same
diversity order as that of the underlying coherent space time block code (STBC)
if a simple minimum mean squared error estimate of the channel formed using the
training part is employed for coherent detection of the underlying STBC. In
this letter, a similar strategy involving a combination of training, channel
estimation and detection in conjunction with existing coherent distributed
STBCs is proposed for noncoherent communication in AF relay networks.
Simulation results show that the proposed simple strategy outperforms
distributed differential space-time coding for AF relay networks. Finally, the
proposed strategy is extended to asynchronous relay networks using orthogonal

games. We consider how much the price of anarchy worsens and how much the price
of stability improves as a function of the approximation factor $\epsilon$. We
give (almost) tight upper and lower bounds for both the price of anarchy and
the price of stability for atomic and non-atomic congestion games. Our results
not only encompass and generalize the existing results of exact equilibria to
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibria, but they also provide a unified approach which
reveals the common threads of the atomic and non-atomic price of anarchy
results. By expanding the spectrum, we also cast the existing results in a new
light. For example, the Pigou network, which gives tight results for exact Nash
equilibria of selfish routing, remains tight for the price of stability of
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibria but not for the price of anarchy.

critical database elements detection as an optimization problem over the graph.
This method is universally applicable over a large class of graphs (including
directed, weighted, disconnected, cyclic) that occur in several contexts of
databases. A generalization argument is presented which extends the critical

multicast, and broadcast traffic are important components of high-speed
metropolitan area networks. For an arbitrary multicast fanout traffic model
with uniform, hotspot destination, and hotspot source packet traffic, we
analyze the maximum achievable long-run average packet throughput, which we
refer to as \textit{multicast capacity}, of bi-directional shortest-path routed
WDM rings. We identify three segments that can experience the maximum
utilization, and thus, limit the multicast capacity. We characterize the
segment utilization probabilities through bounds and approximations, which we
verify through simulations. We discover that shortest-path routing can lead to
utilization probabilities above one half for moderate to large portions of
hotspot source multi- and broadcast traffic, and consequently multicast
capacities of less than two simultaneous packet transmissions. We outline a
one-copy routing strategy that guarantees a multicast capacity of at least two
simultaneous packet transmissions for arbitrary hotspot source traffic.

2D images of 3D neurons (e.g. camera lucida images and other types of 2D
microscopy). Most contour-based shape analysis methods can not be used to
characterize such cells because of overlaps between neuronal processes. The
proposed framework is specifically aimed at the problem of contour following
even in presence of multiple overlaps. First, the input image is preprocessed
in order to obtain an 8-connected skeleton with one-pixel-wide branches, as
well as a set of critical regions (i.e., bifurcations and crossings). Next, for
each subtree, the tracking stage iteratively labels all valid pixel of
branches, up to a critical region, where it determines the suitable direction
to proceed. Finally, the labeled skeleton segments are followed in order to
yield the parametric contour of the neuronal shape under analysis. The reported
system was successfully tested with respect to several images and the results
from a set of three neuron images are presented here, each pertaining to a
different class, i.e. alpha, delta and epsilon ganglion cells, containing a
total of 34 crossings. The algorithms successfully got across all these
overlaps. The method has also been found to exhibit robustness even for images
with close parallel segments. The proposed method is robust and may be
implemented in an efficient manner. The introduction of this approach should
pave the way for more systematic application of contour-based shape analysis
methods in neuronal morphology.

Digital Signal Processing Journal 22 (2012)</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This article introduces an effective generalization of the polar flavor of
the Fourier Theorem based on a new method of analysis. Under the premises of
the new theory an ample class of functions become viable as bases, with the
further advantage of using the same basis for analysis and reconstruction. In
fact other tools, like the wavelets, admit specially built nonorthogonal bases
but require different bases for analysis and reconstruction (biorthogonal and
dual bases) and vectorial coordinates; this renders those systems unintuitive
and computing intensive. As an example of the advantages of the new
generalization of the Fourier Theorem, this paper introduces a novel method for
the synthesis that is based on frequency-phase series of square waves (the
equivalent of the polar Fourier Theorem but for nonorthogonal bases). The
resulting synthesizer is very efficient needing only few components, frugal in
terms of computing needs, and viable for many applications.

the quality of the reconstructed signal when the field samples are irregularly
spaced and affected by independent and identically distributed noise. More
specifically, we apply linear reconstruction techniques and take the mean
square error (MSE) of the field estimate as a metric to evaluate the signal
reconstruction quality. We find that the MSE analysis could be carried out by
using the closed-form expression of the eigenvalue distribution of the matrix
representing the sampling system. Unfortunately, such distribution is still
unknown. Thus, we first derive a closed-form expression of the distribution
moments, and we find that the eigenvalue distribution tends to the
Marcenko-Pastur distribution as the field dimension goes to infinity. Finally,
by using our approach, we derive a tight approximation to the MSE of the
reconstructed field.

  Multiple Antennas</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This paper is concerned with the fading MIMO-MAC with multiple receive
antennas at the base station (BS) and multiple transmit antennas at each mobile
terminal (MT). Two multiple-access techniques are considered for scheduling
transmissions from each MT to the BS at the same frequency, which are
space-division multiple-access (SDMA) and time-division multiple-access (TDMA).
For SDMA, all MTs transmit simultaneously to the BS and their individual
signals are resolved at the BS via multiple receive antennas while for TDMA,
each MT transmits independently to the BS during mutually orthogonal time
slots. It is assumed that the channel-state information (CSI) of the fading
channel from each MT to the BS is unknown at each MT transmitter, but is
perfectly known at the BS receiver. Thereby, the BS can acquire the long-term
channel-distribution information (CDI) for each MT. This paper extends the
well-known transmit-covariance feedback scheme for the point-to-point fading
MIMO channel to the fading MIMO-MAC, whereby the BS jointly optimizes the
transmit signal covariance matrices for all MTs based on their CDI, and then
sends each transmit covariance matrix back to the corresponding MT via a
feedback channel. The main goal of this paper is to characterize the so-called
multiuser power region under the multiuser transmit-covariance feedback scheme
for both SDMA and TDMA. The power region is defined as the constitution of all
user transmit power-tuples that can achieve reliable transmissions for a given
set of user target rates. Simulation results show that SDMA can achieve
substantial power savings over TDMA for the fading MIMO-MAC. Moreover, this
paper demonstrates the usefulness of the multiuser power region for maintaining
proportionally-fair power consumption among the MTs.

wireless network with slow fading for support of data traffic having
heterogeneous transmission delay requirements. The multiple-input single-output
(MISO) fading broadcast channel (BC) is of interest where the base station (BS)
employs multiple transmit antennas to realize simultaneous downlink
transmission at the same frequency to multiple mobile users each having a
single receive antenna. An information-theoretic approach is taken for
characterizing capacity limits of the fading MISO-BC under various transmission
delay considerations. First, this paper studies transmit optimization at the BS
when some users have delay-tolerant ``packet'' data and the others have
delay-sensitive ``circuit'' data for transmission at the same time. Based on
the convex optimization framework, an online resource allocation algorithm is
derived that is amenable to efficient cross-layer implementation of both
physical (PHY) -layer multi-antenna transmission and media-access-control (MAC)
-layer multiuser rate scheduling. Secondly, this paper investigates the
fundamental throughput-delay tradeoff for transmission over the fading MISO-BC.
By comparing the network throughput under completely relaxed versus strictly
zero transmission delay constraint, this paper characterizes the limiting loss
in sum capacity due to the vanishing delay tolerance, termed the delay penalty,
under some prescribed user fairness for transmit rate allocation.

RAT_omega of infinitary rational relations accepted by 2-tape B\&quot;uchi automata
are equal to the Borel and the Wadge hierarchies of omega-languages accepted by
real-time B\&quot;uchi 1-counter automata or by B\&quot;uchi Turing machines. In
particular, for every non-null recursive ordinal $\alpha$, there exist some
$\Sigma^0_\alpha$-complete and some $\Pi^0_\alpha$-complete infinitary rational
relations. And the supremum of the set of Borel ranks of infinitary rational
relations is an ordinal $\gamma^1_2$ which is strictly greater than the first
non-recursive ordinal $\omega_1^{CK}$. This very surprising result gives
answers to questions of Simonnet (1992) and of Lescow and Thomas (1988,1994).

qualitatively different operating regimes--bandwidth- and power-limited--have
proven indispensable in the design of good communication schemes. In this
paper, we propose a new scaling law formulation for wireless networks that
allows us to develop a theory that is analogous to the point-to-point case. We
identify fundamental operating regimes of wireless networks and derive
architectural guidelines for the design of optimal schemes.
  Our analysis shows that in a given wireless network with arbitrary size,
area, power, bandwidth, etc., there are three parameters of importance: the
short-distance SNR, the long-distance SNR, and the power path loss exponent of
the environment. Depending on these parameters we identify four qualitatively
different regimes. One of these regimes is especially interesting since it is
fundamentally a consequence of the heterogeneous nature of links in a network
and does not occur in the point-to-point case; the network capacity is {\em
both} power and bandwidth limited. This regime has thus far remained hidden due
to the limitations of the existing formulation. Existing schemes, either
multihop transmission or hierarchical cooperation, fail to achieve capacity in
this regime; we propose a new hybrid scheme that achieves capacity.

nowadays a general purpose language. CHR programs consist of multi-headed
guarded rules which allow to rewrite constraints into simpler ones until a
solved form is reached. Many empirical evidences suggest that multiple heads
augment the expressive power of the language, however no formal result in this
direction has been proved, so far.
  In the first part of this paper we analyze the Turing completeness of CHR
with respect to the underneath constraint theory. We prove that if the
constraint theory is powerful enough then restricting to single head rules does
not affect the Turing completeness of the language. On the other hand,
differently from the case of the multi-headed language, the single head CHR
language is not Turing powerful when the underlying signature (for the
constraint theory) does not contain function symbols.
  In the second part we prove that, no matter which constraint theory is
considered, under some reasonable assumptions it is not possible to encode the
CHR language (with multi-headed rules) into a single headed language while
preserving the semantics of the programs. We also show that, under some
stronger assumptions, considering an increasing number of atoms in the head of
a rule augments the expressive power of the language.
  These results provide a formal proof for the claim that multiple heads
augment the expressive power of the CHR language.

  Probabilistic Neural Network</title><categories>cs.AI cs.CV</categories><comments>5 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted to IEEE ICTAI 2008</comments><acm-class>I.5.4; I.2.1</acm-class><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders that greatly impair
patient' daily lives. Traditional epileptic diagnosis relies on tedious visual
screening by neurologists from lengthy EEG recording that requires the presence
of seizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many systems helping the
neurologists to quickly find interesting segments of the lengthy signal by
automatic seizure detection. However, we notice that it is very difficult, if
not impossible, to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure activities for
epilepsy patients in areas lack of medical resources and trained neurologists.
Therefore, we propose to study automated epileptic diagnosis using interictal
EEG data that is much easier to collect than ictal data. The authors are not
aware of any report on automated EEG diagnostic system that can accurately
distinguish patients' interictal EEG from the EEG of normal people. The
research presented in this paper, therefore, aims to develop an automated
diagnostic system that can use interictal EEG data to diagnose whether the
person is epileptic. Such a system should also detect seizure activities for
further investigation by doctors and potential patient monitoring. To develop
such a system, we extract four classes of features from the EEG data and build
a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) fed with these features. Leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOO-CV) on a widely used epileptic-normal data set reflects
an impressive 99.5% accuracy of our system on distinguishing normal people's
EEG from patient's interictal EEG. We also find our system can be used in
patient monitoring (seizure detection) and seizure focus localization, with
96.7% and 77.5% accuracy respectively on the data set.

Mining; http://lcdm.astro.uiuc.edu) collaboration between UIUC Astronomy and
NCSA to deploy supercomputing cluster resources and machine learning algorithms
for the mining of terascale astronomical datasets. This is a novel application
in the field of astronomy, because we are using such resources for data mining,
and not just performing simulations. Via a modified implementation of the NCSA
cyberenvironment Data-to-Knowledge, we are able to provide improved
classifications for over 100 million stars and galaxies in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey, improved distance measures, and a full exploitation of the simple
but powerful k-nearest neighbor algorithm. A driving principle of this work is
that our methods should be extensible from current terascale datasets to
upcoming petascale datasets and beyond. We discuss issues encountered to-date,
and further issues for the transition to petascale. In particular, disk I/O
will become a major limiting factor unless the necessary infrastructure is
implemented.

coalitional game theory. Using the rate achieved by a user as its utility, it
is shown that the stable coalition structure, i.e., set of coalitions from
which users have no incentives to defect, depends on the manner in which the
rate gains are apportioned among the cooperating users. Specifically, the
stability of the grand coalition (GC), i.e., the coalition of all users, is
studied. Transmitter and receiver cooperation in an interference channel (IC)
are studied as illustrative cooperative models to determine the stable
coalitions for both flexible (transferable) and fixed (non-transferable)
apportioning schemes. It is shown that the stable sum-rate optimal coalition
when only receivers cooperate by jointly decoding (transferable) is the GC. The
stability of the GC depends on the detector when receivers cooperate using
linear multiuser detectors (non-transferable). Transmitter cooperation is
studied assuming that all receivers cooperate perfectly and that users outside
a coalition act as jammers. The stability of the GC is studied for both the
case of perfectly cooperating transmitters (transferrable) and under a partial
decode-and-forward strategy (non-transferable). In both cases, the stability is
shown to depend on the channel gains and the transmitter jamming strengths.

  Feedback</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>In revision for IEEE Transactions on Communications, April 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The goal of combining beamforming and space-time coding in this work is to
obtain full-diversity order and to provide additional received power (array
gain) compared to conventional space-time codes. In our system, we consider a
quasi-static fading environment and we incorporate both high-rate and low-rate
feedback channels with possible feedback errors. To utilize feedback
information, a class of code constellations is proposed, inspired from
orthogonal designs and precoded space-time block codes, which is called
generalized partly orthogonal designs or generalized PODs. Furthermore, to
model feedback errors, we assume that the feedback bits go through binary
symmetric channels (BSCs). Two cases are studied: first, when the BSC bit error
probability is known a priori to the transmission ends and second, when it is
not known exactly. In the first case, we derive a minimum pairwise error
probability (PEP) design criterion for generalized PODs. Then we design the
quantizer for the erroneous feedback channel and the precoder codebook of PODs
based on this criterion. The quantization scheme in our system is a channel
optimized vector quantizer (COVQ). In the second case, the design of the
quantizer and the precoder codebook is based on similar approaches, however
with a worst-case design strategy. The attractive property of our combining
scheme is that it converges to conventional space-time coding with low-rate and
erroneous feedback and to directional beamforming with high-rate and error-free
feedback. This scheme shows desirable robustness against feedback channel
modeling mismatch.

and reconstruction of sparse phenomena from noisy projections. We consider two
settings: output noise models where the noise enters after the projection and
input noise models where the noise enters before the projection. We consider
two types of distortion for reconstruction: support errors and mean-squared
errors. Our goal is to relate the number of measurements, $m$, and $\snr$, to
signal sparsity, $k$, distortion level, $d$, and signal dimension, $n$. We
consider support errors in a worst-case setting. We employ different variations
of Fano's inequality to derive necessary conditions on the number of
measurements and $\snr$ required for exact reconstruction. To derive sufficient
conditions we develop new insights on max-likelihood analysis based on a novel
superposition property. In particular this property implies that small support
errors are the dominant error events. Consequently, our ML analysis does not
suffer the conservatism of the union bound and leads to a tighter analysis of
max-likelihood. These results provide order-wise tight bounds. For output noise
models we show that asymptotically an $\snr$ of $\Theta(\log(n))$ together with
$\Theta(k \log(n/k))$ measurements is necessary and sufficient for exact
support recovery. Furthermore, if a small fraction of support errors can be
tolerated, a constant $\snr$ turns out to be sufficient in the linear sparsity
regime. In contrast for input noise models we show that support recovery fails
if the number of measurements scales as $o(n\log(n)/SNR)$ implying poor
compression performance for such cases. We also consider Bayesian set-up and
characterize tradeoffs between mean-squared distortion and the number of
measurements using rate-distortion theory.

  Channels</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>30 pages, 9 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio (CR) network in which the
unlicensed (secondary) users are allowed to concurrently access the spectrum
allocated to the licensed (primary) users provided that their interference to
the primary users (PUs) satisfies certain constraints. We study a weighted sum
rate maximization problem for the secondary user (SU) multiple input multiple
output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC), in which the SUs have not only the sum
power constraint but also interference constraints. We first transform this
multi-constraint maximization problem into its equivalent form, which involves
a single constraint with multiple auxiliary variables. Fixing these multiple
auxiliary variables, we propose a duality result for the equivalent problem.
Our duality result can solve the optimization problem for MIMO-BC with multiple
linear constraints, and thus can be viewed as an extension of the conventional
results, which rely crucially on a single sum power constraint. Furthermore, we
develop an efficient sub-gradient based iterative algorithm to solve the
equivalent problem and show that the developed algorithm converges to a
globally optimal solution. Simulation results are further provided to
corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

range of possible additive constants applicable to programming languages is so
large that in practice it plays a major role in the actual evaluation of K(s),
the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity of a string s. Some attempts have been made
to arrive at a framework stable enough for a concrete definition of K,
independent of any constant under a programming language, by appealing to the
&quot;naturalness&quot; of the language in question. The aim of this paper is to present
an approach to overcome the problem by looking at a set of models of
computation converging in output probability distribution such that that
&quot;naturalness&quot; can be inferred, thereby providing a framework for a stable
definition of K under the set of convergent models of computation.

resolution algorithms. The buffered Aloha network is modeled as a multi-queue
single-server system. We adopt a widely used approach in packet switching
systems to decompose the multi-queue system into independent first-in-first-out
(FIFO) queues, which are hinged together by the probability of success of
head-of-line (HOL) packets. A unified method is devised to tackle the stability
and throughput problems of K-exponential backoff with any cutoff phase K. For
networks with a finite number of nodes, we show that the K-exponential backoff
is stable if the retransmission factor is properly chosen from the stable
region. The maximum stable throughput is derived and demonstrated via examples
of geometric retransmission (K=1) and exponential backoff (K=infinity). For
networks with an infinite number of nodes, we show that geometric
retransmission is unstable, and the stable network throughput of exponential
backoff can only be achieved at the cost of potential unbounded delay in each
input queue. Furthermore, we address the stability issue of the systems at the
undesired stable point. All analytical results presented in this paper are
verified and confirmed by simulations.

pseudo-distance. The natural pseudo-distance is a dissimilarity measure between
shapes, where a shape is viewed as a topological space endowed with a
real-valued continuous function. Measuring dissimilarity amounts to minimizing
the change in the functions due to the application of homeomorphisms between
topological spaces, with respect to the $L_\infty$-norm. In order to obtain the
lower bound, a suitable metric between size functions, called matching
distance, is introduced. It compares size functions by solving an optimal
matching problem between countable point sets. The matching distance is shown
to be resistant to perturbations, implying that it is always smaller than the
natural pseudo-distance. We also prove that the lower bound so obtained is
sharp and cannot be improved by any other distance between size functions.

The key property of
the algorithm is that it is affine-invariant, i.e., it produces the same
partition for any affine transformation of the input. It has strong guarantees
when the input is drawn from a mixture model. For a mixture of two arbitrary
Gaussians, the algorithm correctly classifies the sample assuming only that the
two components are separable by a hyperplane, i.e., there exists a halfspace
that contains most of one Gaussian and almost none of the other in probability
mass. This is nearly the best possible, improving known results substantially.
For k &gt; 2 components, the algorithm requires only that there be some
(k-1)-dimensional subspace in which the emoverlap in every direction is small.
Here we define overlap to be the ratio of the following two quantities: 1) the
average squared distance between a point and the mean of its component, and 2)
the average squared distance between a point and the mean of the mixture. The
main result may also be stated in the language of linear discriminant analysis:
if the standard Fisher discriminant is small enough, labels are not needed to
estimate the optimal subspace for projection. Our main tools are isotropic
transformation, spectral projection and a simple reweighting technique. We call
this combination isotropic PCA.

ranking wherein we utilize cluster information within a graph-based framework.
The main idea is to perform re-ranking based on centrality within bipartite
graphs of documents (on one side) and clusters (on the other side), on the
premise that these are mutually reinforcing entities. Links between entities
are created via consideration of language models induced from them.
  We find that our cluster-document graphs give rise to much better retrieval
performance than previously proposed document-only graphs do. For example,
authority-based re-ranking of documents via a HITS-style cluster-based approach
outperforms a previously-proposed PageRank-inspired algorithm applied to
solely-document graphs. Moreover, we also show that computing authority scores
for clusters constitutes an effective method for identifying clusters
containing a large percentage of relevant documents.

for each vertex, which won't change with graph isomorphism and should fully
determine the graph. For example numbers of closed paths of length k for given
starting vertex, what can be though as the diagonal terms of k-th power of the
adjacency matrix. For k=2 we would get degree of verities invariant, higher
describes local topology deeper. Now if two graphs are isomorphic, they have
the same set of such vectors of invariants - we can sort theses vectors
lexicographically and compare them. If they agree, permutations from sorting
allow to reconstruct the isomorphism. I'm presenting arguments that these
invariants should fully determine the graph, but unfortunately I can't prove it
in this moment. This approach can give hope, that maybe P=NP - instead of
checking all instances, we should make arithmetics on these large numbers.

Part 1: vectorial decomposition</title><categories>cs.NA math.FA</categories><comments>15 pages, no figures</comments><journal-ref>Digital Signal Processing Journal, Vol. 17 March 2007</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The famous Fourier theorem states that, under some restrictions, any periodic
function (or real world signal) can be obtained as a sum of sinusoids, and
hence, a technique exists for decomposing a signal into its sinusoidal
components. From this theory an entire branch of research has flourished: from
the Short-Time or Windowed Fourier Transform to the Wavelets, the Frames, and
lately the Generic Frequency Analysis. The aim of this paper is to take the
Frequency Analysis a step further. It will be shown that keeping the same
reconstruction algorithm as the Fourier Theorem but changing to a new computing
method for the analysis phase allows the generalization of the Fourier Theorem
to a large class of nonorthogonal bases. New methods and algorithms can be
employed in function decomposition on such generic bases. It will be shown that
these algorithms are a generalization of the Fourier analysis, i.e. they are
reduced to the familiar Fourier tools when using orthogonal bases. The
differences between this tool and the wavelets and frames theories will be
discussed. Examples of analysis and reconstruction of functions using the given
algorithms and nonorthogonal bases will be given. In this first part the focus
will be on vectorial decomposition, while the second part will be on phased
decomposition. The phased decomposition thanks to a single function basis has
many interesting consequences and applications.

a finite set of words, clumps are maximal overlapping sets of these
occurrences. This parameter has first been studied by Schbath with the aim of
counting the number of occurrences of words in random texts. Later work with
similar probabilistic approach used the Chen-Stein approximation for a compound
Poisson distribution, where the number of clumps follows a law close to
Poisson. Presently there is no combinatorial counterpart to this approach, and
we fill the gap here. We emphasize the fact that, in contrast with the
probabilistic approach which only provides asymptotic results, the
combinatorial approach provides exact results that are useful when considering
short sequences.

detecting statistical dependences and choosing simple graphs that make the
joint measure Markovian. Here we argue why causal inference is also possible
when only single observations are present.
  We develop a theory how to generate causal graphs explaining similarities
between single objects. To this end, we replace the notion of conditional
stochastic independence in the causal Markov condition with the vanishing of
conditional algorithmic mutual information and describe the corresponding
causal inference rules.
  We explain why a consistent reformulation of causal inference in terms of
algorithmic complexity implies a new inference principle that takes into
account also the complexity of conditional probability densities, making it
possible to select among Markov equivalent causal graphs. This insight provides
a theoretical foundation of a heuristic principle proposed in earlier work.
  We also discuss how to replace Kolmogorov complexity with decidable
complexity criteria. This can be seen as an algorithmic analog of replacing the
empirically undecidable question of statistical independence with practical
independence tests that are based on implicit or explicit assumptions on the
underlying distribution.

for specific data better using specific algorithm - JPEG for images, MPEG for
movies, etc. For textual documents there are special methods based on PPM
algorithm or methods with non-character access, e.g. word-based compression. In
the past, several papers describing variants of word-based compression using
Huffman encoding or LZW method were published. The subject of this paper is the
description of a word-based compression variant based on the LZ77 algorithm.
The LZ77 algorithm and its modifications are described in this paper. Moreover,
various ways of sliding window implementation and various possibilities of
output encoding are described, as well. This paper also includes the
implementation of an experimental application, testing of its efficiency and
finding the best combination of all parts of the LZ77 coder. This is done to
achieve the best compression ratio. In conclusion there is comparison of this
implemented application with other word-based compression programs and with
other commonly used compression programs.

technology and its privacy implications. Currently, researchers and the media
focus on the privacy threats posed by RFID, while consumer groups choose to
boycott products bearing RFID tags. At the same, however, a very similar
technology has quietly become part of our everyday lives: Bluetooth. In this
paper we highlight the fact that Bluetooth is a widespread technology that has
real privacy implications. Furthermore, we explore the applicability of
RFID-based solutions to address these privacy implications.

(CIC) on which the proof assistant Coq is based: the Calculus of Congruent
Inductive Constructions, which truly extends CIC by building in arbitrary
first-order decision procedures: deduction is still in charge of the CIC
kernel, while computation is outsourced to dedicated first-order decision
procedures that can be taken from the shelves provided they deliver a proof
certificate. The soundness of the whole system becomes an incremental property
following from the soundness of the certificate checkers and that of the
kernel. A detailed example shows that the resulting style of proofs becomes
closer to that of the working mathematician.

by connecting each point to the $k$ points nearest to it. This graph a.s. has
an infinite cluster if $k &gt; k_c(d)$ where $k_c(d)$, known as the critical
value, depends only on the dimension $d$. This paper presents an improved upper
bound of 188 on the value of $k_c(2)$. We also show that if $k \geq 188$ the
infinite cluster of $\NN(2,k)$ has an infinite subset of points with the
property that the distance along the edges of the graphs between these points
is at most a constant multiplicative factor larger than their Euclidean
distance. Finally we discuss in detail the relevance of our results to the
study of multi-hop wireless sensor networks.

dynamics of scholarship in real time, and to form the basis for the definition
of novel metrics of scholarly impact. However, the formal groundwork to
reliably and validly exploit usage data is lacking, and the exact nature,
meaning and applicability of usage-based metrics is poorly understood. The
MESUR project funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation constitutes a
systematic effort to define, validate and cross-validate a range of usage-based
metrics of scholarly impact. MESUR has collected nearly 1 billion usage events
as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data from significant
publishers, aggregators and institutional consortia to construct a large-scale
usage data reference set. This paper describes some major challenges related to
aggregating and processing usage data, and discusses preliminary results
obtained from analyzing the MESUR reference data set. The results confirm the
intrinsic value of scholarly usage data, and support the feasibility of
reliable and valid usage-based metrics of scholarly impact.

security at lower layers of the network stack for hosts connected to a network.
It claims to reduce the attack vulnerability of a networked host by providing
security mechanisms in a programmable Network Interface Card (NIC). Dynamic
access control mechanisms are implemented in hardware to restrict access to the
services provided, only to authenticated hosts. This reduces server
vulnerability to various layer 2 attacks. Also the services will be immune to
zero-day vulnerabilities due to the minimal code execution paths. To this end,
it presents architecture and implementation details of a programmable network
interface card equipped with these measures. It works alongside, and augments,
existing security protocols making deployment practical.

oriented and has strict QoS requirements. One of the technologies that enabled
this is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking. Traditional ATM networks
are wired networks. But Tactical networks are meant to be mobile and this
necessitates the use of radio relays for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. ATM networks assume a physical link
layer BER of 10^-9 or better because of the availability of reliable media like
optical fiber links. But this assumption is no longer valid when ATM switches
are connected through radio relay where error rates are in the rage of 10^-3.
This paper presents the architecture of a Link Enhancer meant to improve the
Bit Error Rate of the Wireless links used for V2I and V2V communications from 1
in 10^4 to 1 in 10^8

known algorithms for the general problem of learning a k-junta require running
time of n^k * poly(n,2^k), we show that given access to k different product
distributions with biases separated by \gamma&gt;0, the functions may be learned
in time poly(n,2^k,\gamma^{-k}). More generally, given access to t &lt;= k
different product distributions, the functions may be learned in time n^{k/t} *
poly(n,2^k,\gamma^{-k}). Our techniques involve novel results in Fourier
analysis relating Fourier expansions with respect to different biases and a
generalization of Russo's formula.

that a seemingly stronger outer bound is identical to a weaker form of the
outer bound that was also presented in [N-EG'07]. We are able to further
express the best outer bound in a form that is computable, i.e. there are
bounds on the cardinalities of the auxiliary random variables.
  The inner and outer bounds coincide for all channels for which the capacity
region is known and it is not known whether the regions described by these
bounds are same or different. We present a channel, where assuming a certain
conjecture backed by simulations and partial theoretical results, one can show
that the bounds are different.

control system Computer vision offers a new approach to solve this problem. In
this paper, author introduces an image process algorithm of computer vision
navigation for autonomous landing of lunar probe. The purpose of the algorithm
is to detect and track feature points which are factors of navigation. Firstly,
fixation areas are detected as sub-images and matched. Secondly, feature points
are extracted from sub-images and tracked. Computer simulation demonstrates the
result of algorithm takes less computation and fulfils requests of navigation
algorithm.

and way points is a more or less important input variable in most models of
pedestrian dynamics. Except for the special case when there are no obstacles in
a concave scenario -- i.e. each position is visible from any other -- the
calculation of these distances is a non-trivial task. This isn't that big a
problem, as long as the model only demands the distances to be stored in a
Static Floor Field also called Potential Field, which never changes throughout
the whole simulation. In this case a pre-calculation once before the simulation
starts is sufficient. But if one wants to allow changes of the geometry during
a simulation run -- imagine doors or the blocking of a corridor due to some
hazard -- in the Distance Potential Field, calculation time matters strongly.
This contribution gives an overview over existing and new exact and approximate
methods to calculate a potential field, analytical investigations for their
exactness, and tests of their computation speed. The advantages and drawbacks
of the methods are discussed.

cycle. Hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation is a computer simulation that has
the ability to simulate UAV flight characteristic, sensor modeling and actuator
modeling while communicating in real time with the UAV autopilot hardware. HIL
simulation can be used to test the UAV autopilot hardware reliability, test the
closed loop performance of the overall system and tuning the control parameter.
By rigorous testing in the HIL simulator, the risk in the field trial can be
minimized.

The investigation is focused on the effect of its position and shape on
aerodynamics performances of a given V flight formation. Vortices generated the
wing tip of the leader moves downstream forming a pair of opposite rotating
line vortices. These vortices are generally undesirable because they create a
downwash that increases the induced drag on leaders wing. However, this
downwash is also accompanied by an upwash that can beneficial to the followers
wing flying behind the leaders one, namely a favorable lift for the followers
wing. How much contributions of the leaders wing to the followers wing in the V
formation flight is determined by the strength of tip vortices generated by the
leaders wing which is influenced by its position and shape including incidence
angle, dihedral angle, aspect ratio and taper ratio. The prediction of
aerodynamic performances of the V flight formation including lift, drag and
moment coefficients is numerically performed by solving Navier Stokes equations
with k e turbulence model. The computational domain is defined with multiblock
topology to capture the complex geometry arrangement of the V flight formation.

scale rotorcraft during the flight test for linear-frequency-domain system
identification. The input frequency swept is generated automatically as part of
the autopilot control command. Therefore the bandwidth coverage and consistency
of the frequency swept is guaranteed to produce high quality data for system
identification. Beside that we can set the safety parameter during the flight
test (maximum roll or pitch value, minimum altitude, etc) so the safety of the
whole flight test is guaranteed. This autopilot for automated flight test will
be tested using hardware in the loop simulator for hover flight condition.

been contested annually in a robotic student competition in many countries
following the rules initiated at the Trinity College. The approach makes use of
computer simulation and animation in a virtual reality environment. In the
simulation, the amount of time, starting from home until the flame is
destroyed, can be confirmed. The efficacy of algorithms and parameter values
employed can be easily evaluated. Rather than spending time building the real
robot in a trial and error fashion, now students can explore more variation of
algorithm, parameter and sensor-actuator configuration in the early stage of
design. Besides providing additional excitement during learning process and
enhancing students understanding to the engineering aspects of the design, this
approach could become a useful tool to increase the chance of winning the
contest.

at Bandung Institute of Technology in Indonesia has achieved the testing stage
in the field. This testing was still being classified as the early testing,
since some of the preliminary tests were carried out in the scale of the
laboratory. The paper would discuss the laboratory test and several tests that
were done in the field. Discussions were stressed in the procedure and the aim
that will be achieved, along with several early results. The testing was
carried out in the lake with the area around 8300 Ha and the maximum depth of
50 meters. The location of the testing was chosen with consideration of
minimizing the effect of the current and the wave, as well as the location that
was not too far from the Laboratory. The type of testing that will be discussed
in paper was Heading Lock Maneuver Testing. The vehicle was tested to move with
a certain cruising speed, afterwards it was commanded by an arbitrarily
selected heading direction. The response and the behavior of the vehicle were
recorded as the data produced by the testing.

telerobotics system. Internet telerobotics system refers to a robot system
controlled and monitored remotely through the Internet. A robot manipulator
with five degrees of freedom, called Mentor, is employed. Client-server
architecture is chosen as a platform for our Internet telerobotics system.
Three generations of telerobotics systems have evolved in this research. The
first generation was based on CGI and two tiered architecture, where a client
presents a Graphical User Interface to the user, and utilizes the user's data
entry and actions to perform requests to robot server running on a different
machine. The second generation was developed using Java. We also employ Java 3D
for creating and manipulating 3D geometry of manipulator links and for
constructing the structures used in rendering that geometry, resulting in 3D
robot movement simulation presented to the users(clients) through their web
browser. Recent development in our Internet telerobotics includes object
recognition through image captured by a camera, which poses challenging
problem, given the undeterministic latency of the Internet. The third
generation is centered around the use of CORBA for development platform of
distributed internet telerobotics system, aimed at distributing task of
telerobotics system.

useful for the design of the linear control laws, since it is never afforded in
the published literatures. In the first principle approach, the mathematical
model was developed using basic helicopter theory accounting for particular
characteristic of the miniature helicopter. No formal system identification
procedures are required for the proposed model structure. The relevant
published literatures however did not present the linear models required for
the design of linear control laws. The paper presents a step by step
development of linear model for small scale helicopter based on first-principle
approach. Beyond the previous work in literatures, the calculation of the
stability derivatives is presented in detail. A computer program is used to
solve the equilibrium conditions and then calculate the change in aerodynamics
forces and moments due to the change in each degree of freedom and control
input. The detail derivation allows the comprehensive analysis of relative
dominance of vehicle states and input variables to force and moment components.
Hence it facilitates the development of minimum complexity small scale
helicopter dynamics model.

counterparts. This is due to its greater sensitivity to control inputs and
disturbances as well as higher bandwidth of dynamics. This works is focused on
designing practical tracking controller for a small scale helicopter following
predefined trajectories. A tracking controller based on optimal control theory
is synthesized as part of the development of an autonomous helicopter. Some
issues in regards to control constraints are addressed. The weighting between
state tracking performance and control power expenditure is analyzed. Overall
performance of the control design is evaluated based on its time domain
histories of trajectories as well as control inputs.

the nodes of an ad-hoc network in order to guarantee a directed spanning tree
from a given source node and, at the same time, to minimize the energy
consumption (i.e. the energy cost) yielded by the range assignment. Min energy
broadcast is known to be NP-hard.
  We consider random-grid networks where nodes are chosen independently at
random from the $n$ points of a $\sqrt n \times \sqrt n$ square grid in the
plane. The probability of the existence of a node at a given point of the grid
does depend on that point, that is, the probability distribution can be
non-uniform.
  By using information-theoretic arguments, we prove a lower bound
$(1-\epsilon) \frac n{\pi}$ on the energy cost of any feasible solution for
this problem. Then, we provide an efficient solution of energy cost not larger
than $1.1204 \frac n{\pi}$.
  Finally, we present a fully-distributed protocol that constructs a broadcast
range assignment of energy cost not larger than $8n$,thus still yielding
constant approximation. The energy load is well balanced and, at the same time,
the work complexity (i.e. the energy due to all message transmissions of the
protocol) is asymptotically optimal. The completion time of the protocol is
only an $O(\log n)$ factor slower than the optimum. The approximation quality
of our distributed solution is also experimentally evaluated.
  All bounds hold with probability at least $1-1/n^{\Theta(1)}$.

specifications supported by the Abella system is discussed. This approach uses
lambda tree syntax to treat object language binding and encodes binding related
properties in generic judgments. Further, object language specifications are
embedded directly into the reasoning framework through recursive definitions.
The treatment of binding via generic judgments implicitly enforces distinctness
and atomicity in the names used for bound variables. These properties must,
however, be made explicit in reasoning tasks. This objective can be achieved by
allowing recursive definitions to also specify generic properties of atomic
predicates. The utility of these various logical features in the Abella system
is demonstrated through actual reasoning tasks. Brief comparisons with a few
other logic based approaches are also made.

multiprocessor architectures where processors have different speeds. We present
the preemptive algorithm &quot;Save-Energy&quot; that given a schedule of tasks it post
processes it to improve the energy efficiency without any deterioration of the
makespan. In terms of time efficiency, we show that preemptive scheduling in an
asymmetric system can achieve the same or better optimal makespan than in a
symmetric system. Motivited by real multiprocessor systems, we investigate
architectures that exhibit limited asymmetry: there are two essentially
different speeds. Interestingly, this special case has not been studied in the
field of parallel computing and scheduling theory; only the general case was
studied where processors have $K$ essentially different speeds. We present the
non-preemptive algorithm ``Remnants'' that achieves almost optimal makespan. We
provide a refined analysis of a recent scheduling method. Based on this
analysis, we specialize the scheduling policy and provide an algorithm of $(3 +
o(1))$ expected approximation factor. Note that this improves the previous best
factor (6 for two speeds). We believe that our work will convince researchers
to revisit this well studied scheduling problem for these simple, yet
realistic, asymmetric multiprocessor architectures.

  Linear Codes</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>5 pages, to appear in ISIT 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A lower bound on the number of uncorrectable errors of weight half the
minimum distance is derived for binary linear codes satisfying some condition.
The condition is satisfied by some primitive BCH codes, extended primitive BCH
codes, Reed-Muller codes, and random linear codes. The bound asymptotically
coincides with the corresponding upper bound for Reed-Muller codes and random
linear codes. By generalizing the idea of the lower bound, a lower bound on the
number of uncorrectable errors for weights larger than half the minimum
distance is also obtained, but the generalized lower bound is weak for large
weights. The monotone error structure and its related notion larger half and
trial set, which are introduced by Helleseth, Kl{\o}ve, and Levenshtein, are
mainly used to derive the bounds.

or it can be gained by induction from sets of data. Automatic induction of
knowledge from data sets, usually stored in large databases, is called data
mining. Data mining methods are important in the management of complex systems.
There are many technologies available to data mining practitioners, including
Artificial Neural Networks, Regression, and Decision Trees. Neural networks
have been successfully applied in wide range of supervised and unsupervised
learning applications. Neural network methods are not commonly used for data
mining tasks, because they often produce incomprehensible models, and require
long training times. One way in which the collective properties of a neural
network may be used to implement a computational task is by way of the concept
of energy minimization. The Hopfield network is well-known example of such an
approach. The Hopfield network is useful as content addressable memory or an
analog computer for solving combinatorial-type optimization problems. Wan
Abdullah [1] proposed a method of doing logic programming on a Hopfield neural
network. Optimization of logical inconsistency is carried out by the network
after the connection strengths are defined from the logic program; the network
relaxes to neural states corresponding to a valid interpretation. In this
article, we describe how Hopfield network is able to induce logical rules from
large database by using reverse analysis method: given the values of the
connections of a network, we can hope to know what logical rules are entrenched
in the database.

  Cambridge University Press. 30 pages,</comments><acm-class>D.2.5; D.3.2</acm-class><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Tracers provide users with useful information about program executions. In
this article, we propose a ``tracer driver''. From a single tracer, it provides
a powerful front-end enabling multiple dynamic analysis tools to be easily
implemented, while limiting the overhead of the trace generation. The relevant
execution events are specified by flexible event patterns and a large variety
of trace data can be given either systematically or ``on demand''. The proposed
tracer driver has been designed in the context of constraint logic programming;
experiments have been made within GNU-Prolog. Execution views provided by
existing tools have been easily emulated with a negligible overhead.
Experimental measures show that the flexibility and power of the described
architecture lead to good performance. The tracer driver overhead is inversely
proportional to the average time between two traced events. Whereas the
principles of the tracer driver are independent of the traced programming
language, it is best suited for high-level languages, such as constraint logic
programming, where each traced execution event encompasses numerous low-level
execution steps. Furthermore, constraint logic programming is especially hard
to debug. The current environments do not provide all the useful dynamic
analysis tools. They can significantly benefit from our tracer driver which
enables dynamic analyses to be integrated at a very low cost.

algorithms for estimating Shannon entropy in the most general streaming model,
with arbitrary insertions and deletions. This improves on prior results that
obtain suboptimal space bounds in the general model, and near-optimal bounds in
the insertion-only model without sketching. Our high-level approach is simple:
we give algorithms to estimate Renyi and Tsallis entropy, and use them to
extrapolate an estimate of Shannon entropy. The accuracy of our estimates is
proven using approximation theory arguments and extremal properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, a technique which may be useful for other problems. Our
work also yields the best-known and near-optimal additive approximations for
entropy, and hence also for conditional entropy and mutual information.

$d$-polytope along $k$ orthogonal vectors for various input and output forms.
We show that if $d$ and $k$ are part of the input (i.e. not a constant) and we
are interested in output-sensitive algorithms, then in most forms the problem
is equivalent to enumerating vertices of polytopes, except in two where it is
NP-hard. In two other forms the problem is trivial. We also review the
complexity of computing projections when the projection directions are in some
sense non-degenerate. For full-dimensional polytopes containing origin in the
interior, projection is an operation dual to intersecting the polytope with a
suitable linear subspace and so the results in this paper can be dualized by
interchanging vertices with facets and projection with intersection. To compare
the complexity of projection and vertex enumeration, we define new complexity
classes based on the complexity of Vertex Enumeration.

is shown to be a mixture of a Poisson distribution and finitely many Bernoulli
distributions.

  Theory, Toronto, ON, Canada, July 6-11, 2008</comments><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</license><abstract>  In wireless data networks, communication is particularly susceptible to
eavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. Security and privacy systems have
become critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper
considers the problem of secret communication over a Gaussian broadcast
channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential
messages to two users with \emph{information-theoretic secrecy}. That is, each
user would like to obtain its own confidential message in a reliable and safe
manner. This communication model is referred to as the multi-antenna Gaussian
broadcast channel with confidential messages (MGBC-CM). Under this
communication scenario, a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and the
corresponding achievable secrecy rate region are first developed based on
Gaussian codebooks. Next, a computable Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy
capacity region is provided for the MGBC-CM. Furthermore, the Sato-type outer
bound proves to be consistent with the boundary of the secret dirty-paper
coding achievable rate region, and hence, the secrecy capacity region of the
MGBC-CM is established. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates that both
users can achieve positive rates simultaneously under the information-theoretic
secrecy requirement.

several areas such as system configuration, performance analysis and protocol
design. In order to evaluate distance distributions in random networks, the
underlying nodal arrangement is almost universally taken to be an infinite
Poisson point process. While this assumption is valid in some cases, there are
also certain impracticalities to this model. For example, practical networks
are non-stationary, and the number of nodes in disjoint areas are not
independent. This paper considers a more realistic network model where a finite
number of nodes are uniformly randomly distributed in a general d-dimensional
ball of radius R and characterizes the distribution of Euclidean distances in
the system. The key result is that the probability density function of the
distance from the center of the network to its nth nearest neighbor follows a
generalized beta distribution. This finding is applied to study network
characteristics such as energy consumption, interference, outage and
connectivity.

Inform. Theory, April 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We consider three capacity definitions for general channels with channel side
information at the receiver, where the channel is modeled as a sequence of
finite dimensional conditional distributions not necessarily stationary,
ergodic, or information stable. The {\em Shannon capacity} is the highest rate
asymptotically achievable with arbitrarily small error probability. The {\em
capacity versus outage} is the highest rate asymptotically achievable with a
given probability of decoder-recognized outage. The {\em expected capacity} is
the highest average rate asymptotically achievable with a single encoder and
multiple decoders, where the channel side information determines the decoder in
use. As a special case of channel codes for expected rate, the code for
capacity versus outage has two decoders: one operates in the non-outage states
and decodes all transmitted information, and the other operates in the outage
states and decodes nothing. Expected capacity equals Shannon capacity for
channels governed by a stationary ergodic random process but is typically
greater for general channels. These alternative capacity definitions
essentially relax the constraint that all transmitted information must be
decoded at the receiver. We derive capacity theorems for these capacity
definitions through information density. Numerical examples are provided to
demonstrate their connections and differences. We also discuss the implication
of these alternative capacity definitions for end-to-end distortion,
source-channel coding and separation.

network is as small as the diameter of random graphs but whose nodes are highly
clustered when compared with the ones in a random graph. Examples of
small-world networks abound in sociology, biology, neuroscience and physics as
well as in human-made networks. This paper analyzes the average delivery time
of messages in dense small-world networks constructed on a plane. Iterative
equations for the average message delivery time in these networks are provided
for the situation in which nodes employ a simple greedy geographic routing
algorithm. It is shown that two network nodes communicate with each other only
through their short-range contacts, and that the average message delivery time
rises linearly if the separation between them is small. On the other hand, if
their separation increases, the average message delivery time rapidly saturates
to a constant value and stays almost the same for all large values of their
separation.

networks have focused on the case where the capacities of links in the network
are independent. In this paper, we consider a more realistic model, where
wireless networks are modelled by random geometric graphs with interference and
noise. In this model, the capacities of links are not independent. By employing
coupling and martingale methods, we show that, under mild conditions, the
network coding capacity for random wireless networks still exhibits a
concentration behavior around the mean value of the minimum cut.

medium. This paper presents a throughput-optimal transmission strategy for a
unicast network when feedback is available, which has the following advantages:
It requires a very limited form of acknowledgment feedback. It is completely
distributed, and independent of the network topology. Finally, communication at
the information theoretic cut-set rate requires no network coding and no
rateless coding on the packets. This simple strategy consists of each node
randomly choosing a packet from its buffer to transmit at each opportunity.
However, the packet is only deleted from a node's buffer once it has been
successfully received by the final destination

Decomposition are proposed, one yielding the so called economy decomposition,

handling matrices bigger than the biggest blocks, so it is particularly
appropriate when a limitation on the size of matrices exists. The method is
tested on a document-term matrix (17780x3204) divided in 4 blocks, the
upper-left corner being 215x215.

fact that many physical error models lead to a significant asymmetry between
the probabilities for bit flip and phase flip errors. An example for a channel
which exhibits such asymmetry is the combined amplitude damping and dephasing
channel, where the probabilities of bit flips and phase flips can be related to
relaxation and dephasing time, respectively. We give systematic constructions
of asymmetric quantum stabilizer codes that exploit this asymmetry. Our
approach is based on a CSS construction that combines BCH and finite geometry
LDPC codes.

study of star-products is the calculation of Hochschild cohomology. The aim of
this article is precisely to determine the Hochschild homology and cohomology
in two cases of algebraic varieties. On the one hand, we consider singular
curves of the plane; here we recover, in a different way, a result proved by
Fronsdal and make it more precise. On the other hand, we are interested in
Klein surfaces. The use of a complex suggested by Kontsevich and the help of
Groebner bases allow us to solve the problem.

using as a basis a couple of generic functions, and hence vectorial
decomposition. Here we complete the paradigm exploiting one of the analysis
methodologies developed there, but applied to phase coordinates, so needing
only one function as a basis. It will be shown that, thanks to the novel
iterative analysis, any function satisfying a rather loose requisite is
ontologically a basis. This in turn generalizes the polar version of the
Fourier theorem to an ample class of nonorthogonal bases. The main advantage of
this generalization is that it inherits some of the properties of the original
Fourier theorem. As a result the new transform has a wide range of applications
and some remarkable consequences. The new tool will be compared with wavelets
and frames. Examples of analysis and reconstruction of functions using the
developed algorithms and generic bases will be given. Some of the properties,
and applications that can promptly benefit from the theory, will be discussed.
The implementation of a matched filter for noise suppression will be used as an
example of the potential of the theory.

to analyze real-time systems described using a continuous notion of time and a
mixture of operational (i.e., automata-based) and descriptive (i.e.,
logic-based) formalisms. The technique relies on the reduction, under
reasonable assumptions, of the continuous-time verification problem to its
discrete-time counterpart. This reconciles in a viable and effective way the
dense/discrete and operational/descriptive dichotomies that are often
encountered in practice when it comes to specifying and analyzing complex
critical systems. The article investigates the applicability of the technique
through a significant example centered on a communication protocol. More
precisely, concurrent runs of the protocol are formalized by parallel instances
of a Timed Automaton, while the synchronization rules between these instances
are specified through Metric Temporal Logic formulas, thus creating a
multi-paradigm model. Verification tests run on this model using a bounded
validity checker implementing the technique show consistent results and
interesting performances.

over rings is developed. This framework facilitates linear-programming based
reception for coded modulation systems which use direct modulation mapping of
coded symbols. It is proved that the resulting LP decoder has the
'maximum-likelihood certificate' property. It is also shown that the decoder
output is the lowest cost pseudocodeword. Equivalence between pseudocodewords
of the linear program and pseudocodewords of graph covers is proved. It is also
proved that if the modulator-channel combination satisfies a particular
symmetry condition, the codeword error rate performance is independent of the
transmitted codeword. Two alternative polytopes for use with linear-programming
decoding are studied, and it is shown that for many classes of codes these
polytopes yield a complexity advantage for decoding. These polytope
representations lead to polynomial-time decoders for a wide variety of
classical nonbinary linear codes. LP decoding performance is illustrated for
the [11,6] ternary Golay code with ternary PSK modulation over AWGN, and in
this case it is shown that the performance of the LP decoder is comparable to
codeword-error-rate-optimum hard-decision based decoding. LP decoding is also
simulated for medium-length ternary and quaternary LDPC codes with
corresponding PSK modulations over AWGN.

estimation problem is proposed in this paper. This bound utilizes a well-known
connection to the deterministic estimation setting. Using the prior
distribution, the bias function which minimizes the Cramer-Rao bound can be
determined, resulting in a lower bound on the Bayesian MSE. The bound is
developed for the general case of a vector parameter with an arbitrary
probability distribution, and is shown to be asymptotically tight in both the
high and low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. A numerical study demonstrates
several cases in which the proposed technique is both simpler to compute and
tighter than alternative methods.

characterization of a peristaltic micropump. The micropump is composed of two
layers fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material. The first layer
has a rectangular channel and two valve seals. Three rectangular mini
lightweight piezo-composite actuators are integrated in the second layer, and
used as actuation parts. Two layers are bonded, and covered by two polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) plates, which help increase the stiffness of the micropump.
A maximum flow rate of 900 mokroliter per min and a maximum backpressure of 1.8
kPa are recorded when water is used as pump liquid. We measured the power
consumption of the micropump. The micropump is found to be a promising
candidate for bio-medical application due to its bio-compatibility,
portability, bidirectionality, and simple effective design.

Copula is a statistical theory on dependence and measurement of association.
Graphical models are considered as a type of special case of copula families,
named product copula. In this paper, a nonparametric algorithm for copula
estimation is presented. Then a Chow-Liu like method based on dependence
measure via copula is proposed to estimate maximum spanning product copula with
only bivariate dependence relations. The advantage of the framework is that
learning with empirical copula focuses only on dependence relations among
random variables, without knowing the properties of individual variables.
Another advantage is that copula is a universal model of dependence and
therefore the framework based on it can be generalized to deal with a wide
range of complex dependence relations. Experiments on both simulated data and
real application data show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

gain in the undirected case. A tightened bound for the undirected multicast
problem with three terminals is derived. An interesting result shows that with
fractional routing, routing throughput can achieve at least 75% of the coding
throughput. A tighter bound for the general multicast problem with any number
of terminals shows that coding gain is strictly less than 2. Our derived bound
depends on the number of terminals in the multicast network and approaches 2
for arbitrarily large number of terminals.

exists c_d &gt; 0 such that for every n-point set S in R^d there is a point p in
R^d contained in at least c_d n^{d+1} - O(n^d) of the simplices spanned by S.
  We investigate the largest possible value of c_d. It was known that c_d &lt;=
1/(2^d(d+1)!) (this estimate actually holds for every point set S). We
construct sets showing that c_d &lt;= (d+1)^{-(d+1)}, and we conjecture this
estimate to be tight. The best known lower bound, due to Wagner, is c_d &gt;=
gamma_d := (d^2+1)/((d+1)!(d+1)^{d+1}); in his method, p can be chosen as any
centerpoint of S. We construct n-point sets with a centerpoint that is
contained in no more than gamma_d n^{d+1}+O(n^d) simplices spanned by S, thus
showing that the approach using an arbitrary centerpoint cannot be further
improved.
  We also prove that for every n-point set S in R^d there exists a (d-2)-flat
that stabs at least c_{d,d-2} n^3 - O(n^2) of the triangles spanned by S, with
c_{d,d-2}&gt;=(1/24)(1- 1/(2d-1)^2). To this end, we establish an equipartition
result of independent interest (generalizing planar results of Buck and Buck
and of Ceder): Every mass distribution in R^d can be divided into 4d-2 equal
parts by 2d-1 hyperplanes intersecting in a common (d-2)-flat.

  Issue: 7, Pages: 3297-3303</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We characterize the generalized degrees of freedom of the $K$ user symmetric
Gaussian interference channel where all desired links have the same
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and all undesired links carrying interference have
the same interference-to-noise ratio, ${INR}={SNR}^\alpha$. We find that the
number of generalized degrees of freedom per user, $d(\alpha)$, does not depend
on the number of users, so that the characterization is identical to the 2 user
interference channel with the exception of a singularity at $\alpha=1$ where
$d(1)=\frac{1}{K}$. The achievable schemes use multilevel coding with a nested
lattice structure that opens the possibility that the sum of interfering
signals can be decoded at a receiver even though the messages carried by the
interfering signals are not decodable.

In particular, it is shown that if independent white Gaussian noise is added to

the Hessian matrix of the entropy and entropy power functions with respect to
the variances of the signal components, which is an interesting result in its

states cannot be distilled into pure entanglement. An example is the positive
partial transposition criterion. Here we present, for the first time, the
analogous thing for secret correlations. We introduce a computable criterion
which certifies that a probability distribution between two honest parties and
an eavesdropper cannot be (asymptotically) distilled into a secret key. The
existence of non-distillable correlations with positive secrecy cost, also
known as bound information, is an open question. This criterion may be the key
for finding bound information. However, if it turns out that this criterion
does not detect bound information, then, a very interesting consequence
follows: any distribution with positive secrecy cost can increase the secrecy
content of another distribution. In other words, all correlations with positive
secrecy cost constitute a useful resource.

equilibria) in normal form games, where the number of players is a small
constant. We consider the approach of looking for solutions with constant
support size. It is known from recent work that in the 2-player case, a
1/2-Nash equilibrium can be easily found, but in general one cannot achieve a
smaller value of epsilon than 1/2. In this paper we extend those results to the
k-player case, and find that epsilon = 1-1/k is feasible, but cannot be
improved upon. We show how stronger results for the 2-player case may be used
in order to slightly improve upon the epsilon = 1-1/k obtained in the k-player
case.

coverage for a reactive system under test. We formulate the problem as a
repeated game between the tester and the system, where the system state space
is partitioned according to some coverage criterion and the objective of the
tester is to maximize the set of partitions (or coverage goals) visited during
the game. We show the complexity of the maximal coverage problem for
non-deterministic systems is PSPACE-complete, but is NP-complete for
deterministic systems. For the special case of non-deterministic systems with a
re-initializing ``reset'' action, which represent running a new test input on a
re-initialized system, we show that the complexity is again co-NP-complete. Our
proof technique for reset games uses randomized testing strategies that
circumvent the exponentially large memory requirement in the deterministic
case.

At every round of the game,
each player simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointly
determine the transition to a successor state. Two basic objectives are the
safety objective: ``stay forever in a set F of states'', and its dual, the
reachability objective, ``reach a set R of states''. We present in this paper a
strategy improvement algorithm for computing the value of a concurrent safety
game, that is, the maximal probability with which player 1 can enforce the
safety objective. The algorithm yields a sequence of player-1 strategies which
ensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to the value of the
safety game.
  The significance of the result is twofold. First, while strategy improvement
algorithms were known for Markov decision processes and turn-based games, as
well as for concurrent reachability games, this is the first strategy
improvement algorithm for concurrent safety games. Second, and most
importantly, the improvement algorithm provides a way to approximate the value
of a concurrent safety game from below (the known value-iteration algorithms
approximate the value from above). Thus, when used together with
value-iteration algorithms, or with strategy improvement algorithms for
reachability games, our algorithm leads to the first practical algorithm for
computing converging upper and lower bounds for the value of reachability and
safety games.

Data linkages are intended for
modelling the states of computations in which dynamic data structures are

means of certain actions. We describe the state changes and replies that result
from performing those actions by means of a term rewriting system with rule
priorities. The model in question is an upgrade of molecular dynamics. The
upgrading is mainly concerned with the features to deal with values and the
features to reclaim garbage.

answer increasingly needs of scientific computing. This technology consists
mainly in exploiting PC resources, geographically dispersed, to treat time
consuming applications and/or important storage capacity requiring
applications. However, as resources number increases, the need for scalability,
self-organisation, dynamic reconfiguration, decentralization and performance
becomes more and more essential. In this context, this paper evaluates the
scalability and performance of P2P tools for registering and discovering
services (Publish/Subscribe systems). Three protocols are used in this purpose:
Bonjour, Avahi and Pastry. We have studied the behaviour of these protocols
related to two criteria: the elapsed time for registrations services and the
needed time to discover new services.

  247-255</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Recently, a new method for encoding data sets in the form of &quot;Density Codes&quot;
was proposed in the literature (Courrieu, 2006). This method allows to compare
sets of points belonging to every multidimensional space, and to build shape
spaces invariant to a wide variety of affine and non-affine transformations.
However, this general method does not take advantage of the special properties
of image data, resulting in a quite slow encoding process that makes this tool
practically unusable for processing large image databases with conventional
computers. This paper proposes a very simple variant of the density code method
that directly works on the image function, which is thousands times faster than
the original Parzen window based method, without loss of its useful properties.

over fading channels are studied. The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is
used to analyze the system performance for all possible transmission rates. It
is revealed from the analysis that the design of such rateless codes follows
the design principle of approximately universal codes for parallel
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, in which each sub-channel is a
MIMO channel. More specifically, it is shown that for a single-input
single-output (SISO) channel, the previously developed permutation codes of
unit length for parallel channels having rate LR can be transformed directly
into rateless codes of length L having multiple rate levels (R, 2R, . . ., LR),
to achieve the DMT performance limit.

geometric and combinatorial. The geometric approach starts with a geometric
constraint on the measurement matrix and then uses linear programming to decode
information about the signal from its measurements. The combinatorial approach
constructs the measurement matrix and a combinatorial decoding algorithm to
match. We present a unified approach to these two classes of sparse signal
recovery algorithms.
  The unifying elements are the adjacency matrices of high-quality unbalanced
expanders. We generalize the notion of Restricted Isometry Property (RIP),
crucial to compressed sensing results for signal recovery, from the Euclidean
norm to the l_p norm for p about 1, and then show that unbalanced expanders are
essentially equivalent to RIP-p matrices.
  From known deterministic constructions for such matrices, we obtain new
deterministic measurement matrix constructions and algorithms for signal
recovery which, compared to previous deterministic algorithms, are superior in
either the number of measurements or in noise tolerance.

relaying protocol is presented. A specific scenario, where the inter-relay
channel is sufficiently strong, is considered. Assuming perfect source-relay
transmissions, the proposed scheme further improves the diversity performance
of previously proposed repetition-coded concurrent DF relaying, in which the
advantage of the inter-relay interference is not fully extracted.

understanding of the structure and dynamics of genetic networks is not yet at
hand. In this work we investigate these properties within an artificial genome
model originally introduced by Reil. We analyze statistical properties of
randomly generated genomes both on the sequence- and network level, and show
that this model correctly predicts the frequency of genes in genomes as found
in experimental data. Using an evolutionary algorithm based on stabilizing
selection for a phenotype, we show that robustness against single base
mutations, as well as against random changes in initial network states that
mimic stochastic fluctuations in environmental conditions, can emerge in
parallel. Evolved genomes exhibit characteristic patterns on both sequence and
network level.

body explorations, especially, detailed in-situ surface exploration by tiny
rover is one of effective and fruitful means and is expected to make strong
contributions towards scientific studies. JAXA ISAS is promoting MUSES C
mission, which is the worlds first sample and return attempt to or from the
near earth asteroid. Hayabusa spacecraft in MUSES C mission took the tiny
rover, which was expected to perform the in-situ surface exploration by
hopping. This paper describes the system design, mobility and intelligence of
the developed unmanned explorer. This paper also presents the ground
experimental results and the flight results.

and Revesz, spatio-temporal data are modelled as a finite collection of
triangles that are transformed by time-dependent affinities of the plane. To
facilitate querying and animation of spatio-temporal data, we present a normal
form for data in the geometric data model. We propose an algorithm for
constructing this normal form via a spatio-temporal triangulation of geometric
data objects. This triangulation algorithm generates new geometric data objects
that partition the given objects both in space and in time. A particular
property of the proposed partition is that it is invariant under time-dependent
affine transformations, and hence independent of the particular choice of
coordinate system used to describe he spatio-temporal data in. We can show that
our algorithm works correctly and has a polynomial time complexity (of
reasonably low degree in the number of input triangles and the maximal degree
of the polynomial functions that describe the transformation functions). We
also discuss several possible applications of this spatio-temporal
triangulation.

  (Africa-MS), 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This paper aims to showcase the measure of structural diversity of an
ensemble of 9 classifiers and then map a relationship between this structural
diversity and accuracy. The structural diversity was induced by having
different architectures or structures of the classifiers The Genetical
Algorithms (GA) were used to derive the relationship between diversity and the
classification accuracy by evolving the classifiers and then picking 9
classifiers out on an ensemble of 60 classifiers. It was found that as the
ensemble became diverse the accuracy improved. However at a certain diversity
measure the accuracy began to drop. The Kohavi-Wolpert variance method is used
to measure the diversity of the ensemble. A method of voting is used to
aggregate the results from each classifier. The lowest error was observed at a
diversity measure of 0.16 with a mean square error of 0.274, when taking 0.2024
as maximum diversity measured. The parameters that were varied were: the number
of hidden nodes, learning rate and the activation function.

lattice L\subseteq \R^n, the \emph{subspace avoiding problem} SAP is to find a
shortest vector in L\setminus M. Treating k as a parameter, we obtain new
parameterized approximation and exact algorithms for SAP based on the AKS
sieving technique. More precisely, we give a randomized
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for parameterized SAP that runs in time
2^{O(n)}.(1/\epsilon)^k, where the parameter k is the dimension of the subspace
M. Thus, we obtain a 2^{O(n)} time algorithm for \epsilon=2^{-O(n/k)}. We also
give a 2^{O(n+k\log k)} exact algorithm for the parameterized SAP for any
\ell_p norm.
  Several of our algorithms work for all gauge functions as metric with some
natural restrictions, in particular for all \ell_p norms. We also prove an
\Omega(2^n) lower bound on the query complexity of AKS sieving based exact
algorithms for SVP that accesses the gauge function as oracle.

control system which uses the PI controller to compensate the contour error
between axes. In this paper, the stage adoptive is designed by our laboratory
(Precision Machine Center of National Formosa University). The cross-coupling
controller calculates the actuating signal of each axis by combining multi-axes
position error. Hence, the cross-coupling controller improves the stage
tracking ability and decreases the contour error. The experiments show
excellent stage motion. This finding confirms that the proposed method is a
powerful and efficient tool for improving stage tracking ability. Also found
were the stages tracking to minimize contour error of two types circular to
approximately 25nm.

vehicles move from an initial position and orientation to final position and
orientation. A long the motion, the two vehicles are not allowed to collide
however the two vehicles cant to far each other. The optimal control of the
vehicle is found using the Pontryagins Maximum Principle (PMP). This PMP leads
to a Hamiltonian system consisting of a system of differential equation and its
adjoint. The originally differential equation has initial and final condition
but the adjoint system doesn't have one. The classical difficulty is solved
numerically by the greatest gradient descent method. Some simulation results
are presented in this paper.

means of computational fluid dynamics are presented. Two different kinds of
motions are used for determining the dynamic yaw stability derivatives CNr and
CNbeta . Concerning the first one, simple lateral translation and yaw rotary
motions in yaw are considered. The second one consists of combined motions. To
determine dynamic yaw stability derivatives of the bird, the simulation of an
unsteady flow with a bird model showing a harmonic motion is performed. The
unsteady flow solution for each time step is obtained by solving unsteady Euler
equations based on a finite volume approach for a smaller reduced frequency.
Then, an evaluation of unsteady forces and moments for one cycle is conducted
using harmonic Fourier analysis. The results on the dynamic yaw stability
derivatives for both simulations of the model motion show a good agreement.

Fuzzy PD feedback is presented for a pneumatic control system with nonsmooth
nonlinearities and uncertain parameters. The wavelet transform is employed to
extract the learnable dynamics from measured output signal before it can be
used to update the control profile. The wavelet transform is adopted to
decompose the original signal into many low-resolution signals that contain the
learnable and unlearnable parts. The desired control profile is then compared
with the learnable part of the transformed signal. Thus, the effects from
unlearnable dynamics on the controlled system can be attenuated by a Fuzzy PD
feedback controller. As for the rules of Fuzzy PD controller in the feedback
loop, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to search for the inference rules of
optimization. A proportional-valve controlled pneumatic cylinder actuator
system is used as the control target for simulation. Simulation results have
shown a much-improved positiontracking performance.

the ortho para H2 (o p H2) conversion yield. First, we invoke two processes
derived from fundamental, surface science insights, based on the effect of
molecular orientation on the hydrogen solid surface reaction, i.e., dynamical
quantum filtering and steering, and apply them to enhance the o p H2 conversion
yield. Second, we find an important factor that can significantly influence the
yield i.e., inhomogeneity of spin density distribution. This factor gives us a
promising possibility to increase the yield and to find the best catalyst e.g.,
design of materials that can function as catalysts for the o p H2 conversion.

neurocomputational modeling of learning, pattern matching, and pattern
recognition. In these last two cases, the solution must be obtained on-line,
thus the time required to solve a system in a plausible neural architecture is
critical. This paper presents a recurrent network of Sigma-Pi neurons, whose
solving time increases at most like the logarithm of the system size, and of
its condition number, which provides plausible computation times for biological
systems.

in order to obtain synaptic weights. Moore-Penrose inverse matrices allow for
solving such systems, even with rank deficiency, and they provide minimum-norm
vectors of synaptic weights, which contribute to the regularization of the
input-output mapping. It is thus of interest to develop fast and accurate
algorithms for computing Moore-Penrose inverse matrices. In this paper, an
algorithm based on a full rank Cholesky factorization is proposed. The
resulting pseudoinverse matrices are similar to those provided by other
algorithms. However the computation time is substantially shorter, particularly
for large systems.

\cup K, E)$, where each agent $v \in V$ is adjacent to exactly one constraint
$i \in I$ and exactly one objective $k \in K$. Each agent $v$ controls a
variable $x_v$. For each $i \in I$ we have a nonnegative linear constraint on
the variables of adjacent agents. For each $k \in K$ we have a nonnegative
linear objective function of the variables of adjacent agents. The task is to
maximise the minimum of the objective functions. We study local algorithms
where each agent $v$ must choose $x_v$ based on input within its
constant-radius neighbourhood in $\myG$. We show that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$
there exists a local algorithm achieving the approximation ratio ${\Delta_I (1
- 1/\Delta_K)} + \epsilon$. We also show that this result is the best possible
-- no local algorithm can achieve the approximation ratio ${\Delta_I (1 -
1/\Delta_K)}$. Here $\Delta_I$ is the maximum degree of a vertex $i \in I$, and
$\Delta_K$ is the maximum degree of a vertex $k \in K$. As a methodological
contribution, we introduce the technique of graph unfolding for the design of
local approximation algorithms.

somebody pours water into the cups. The total rate at which the water flows
into the cups is 1. A player moves in the plane with unit speed, emptying the
cups. At any time, the player sees how much water there is in every cup. The
player has no information on how the water will be poured into the cups in the
future; in particular, the pouring may depend on the player's motion. The
backlog of the player is the maximum amount of water in any cup at any time,
and the player's objective is to minimise the backlog. Let $D$ be the diameter
of $P$. If the water is poured at the rate of 1/2 into the cups at the ends of
a diameter, the backlog is $\Omega(D)$. We show that there is a strategy for a
player that guarantees the backlog of $O(D)$, matching the lower bound up to a
multiplicative constant. Note that our guarantee is independent of the number
of the cups.

well-studied problems, including classical and quantum communication
complexity, the complexity of simulating distributions arising from bipartite
measurements of shared quantum states, and XOR games. In this model, Alice gets
an input x, Bob gets an input y, and their goal is to each produce an output
a,b distributed according to some pre-specified joint distribution p(a,b|x,y).
  We introduce a new technique based on affine combinations of lower-complexity
distributions. Specifically, we introduce two complexity measures, one which
gives lower bounds on classical communication, and one for quantum
communication. These measures can be expressed as convex optimization problems.
We show that the dual formulations have a striking interpretation, since they
coincide with maximum violations of Bell and Tsirelson inequalities. The dual
expressions are closely related to the winning probability of XOR games. These
lower bounds subsume many known communication complexity lower bound methods,
most notably the recent lower bounds of Linial and Shraibman for the special
case of Boolean functions.
  We show that the gap between the quantum and classical lower bounds is at
most linear in the size of the support of the distribution, and does not depend
on the size of the inputs. This translates into a bound on the gap between
maximal Bell and Tsirelson inequality violations, which was previously known
only for the case of distributions with Boolean outcomes and uniform marginals.
  Finally, we give an exponential upper bound on quantum and classical
communication complexity in the simultaneous messages model, for any
non-signaling distribution. One consequence is a simple proof that any quantum
distribution can be approximated with a constant number of bits of
communication.

social interactions among their users. The video response feature allows users
to interact and converse through video, by creating a video sequence that
begins with an opening video and followed by video responses from other users.
Our characterization is over 3.4 million videos and 400,000 video responses
collected from YouTube during a 7-day period. We first analyze the
characteristics of the video responses, such as popularity, duration, and
geography. We then examine the social networks that emerge from the video
response interactions.

fading Gaussian interference channels (IFCs) and compound multiaccess channels
(C-MACs). The senders in an IFC communicate with their own receiver (unicast)
while those in a C-MAC communicate with both receivers (multicast). The
instantaneous fading state between every transmit-receive pair in this network
is assumed to be known at all transmitters and receivers. Under an average
power constraint at each source, the sum-capacity of the C-MAC and the power
policy that achieves this capacity is developed. The conditions defining the
classes of strong and very strong ergodic IFCs are presented and the multicast
sum-capacity is shown to be tight for both classes.

a new service. The services called during the orchestration guarantee a given
performance to the orchestrater, usually in the form of contracts. These
contracts can be used by the orchestrater to deduce the contract it can offer
to its own clients, by performing contract composition. An implicit assumption
in contract based QoS management is: &quot;the better the component services
perform, the better the orchestration's performance will be&quot;. Thus, contract
based QoS management for Web services orchestrations implicitly assumes
monotony. In some orchestrations, however, monotony can be violated, i.e., the
performance of the orchestration improves when the performance of a component
service degrades. This is highly undesirable since it can render the process of
contract composition inconsistent. In this paper we define monotony for
orchestrations modelled by Colored Occurrence Nets (CO-nets) and we
characterize the classes of monotonic orchestrations. We show that few
orchestrations are indeed monotonic, mostly since latency can be traded for
quality of data. We also propose a sound refinement of monotony, called
conditional monotony, which forbids this kind of cheating and show that
conditional monotony is widely satisfied by orchestrations. This finding leads
to reconsidering the way SLAs should be formulated.

the soft margin parameter C and the parameters of the kernel. To perform this
model selection task, the method of choice is cross-validation. Its
leave-one-out variant is known to produce an estimator of the generalization
error which is almost unbiased. Its major drawback rests in its time
requirement. To overcome this difficulty, several upper bounds on the
leave-one-out error of the pattern recognition SVM have been derived. Among
those bounds, the most popular one is probably the radius-margin bound. It
applies to the hard margin pattern recognition SVM, and by extension to the
2-norm SVM. In this report, we introduce a quadratic loss M-SVM, the M-SVM^2,
as a direct extension of the 2-norm SVM to the multi-class case. For this
machine, a generalized radius-margin bound is then established.

through a relay in the middle. The channels between the transmitters and the
relay are assumed to be synchronized, average power constrained additive white
Gaussian noise channels with a real input with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of
snr. An upper bound on the capacity is 1/2 log(1+ snr) bits per transmitter per
use of the medium-access phase and broadcast phase of the bi-directional relay
channel. We show that using lattice codes and lattice decoding, we can obtain a
rate of 1/2 log(0.5 + snr) bits per transmitter, which is essentially optimal
at high SNRs. The main idea is to decode the sum of the codewords modulo a
lattice at the relay followed by a broadcast phase which performs Slepian-Wolf
coding with structured codes. For asymptotically low SNR's, jointly decoding
the two transmissions at the relay (MAC channel) is shown to be optimal. We
also show that if the two transmitters use identical lattices with minimum
angle decoding, we can achieve the same rate of 1/2 log(0.5 + snr). The
proposed scheme can be thought of as a joint physical layer, network layer code
which outperforms other recently proposed analog network coding schemes.

We
first address voxel-based polyhedra (polycubes), formed as the union of a
collection of cubical (axis-aligned) voxels. We analyze the ways in which the
skeleton may intersect each voxel of the polyhedron, and show that the skeleton
may be constructed by a simple voxel-sweeping algorithm taking constant time
per voxel. In addition, we describe a more complex algorithm for straight
skeletons of voxel-based polyhedra, which takes time proportional to the area
of the surfaces of the straight skeleton rather than the volume of the
polyhedron. We also consider more general polyhedra with axis-parallel edges
and faces, and show that any n-vertex polyhedron of this type has a straight
skeleton with O(n^2) features. We provide algorithms for constructing the
straight skeleton, with running time O(min(n^2 log n, k log^{O(1)} n)) where k
is the output complexity. Next, we discuss the straight skeleton of a general
nonconvex polyhedron. We show that it has an ambiguity issue, and suggest a
consistent method to resolve it. We prove that the straight skeleton of a
general polyhedron has a superquadratic complexity in the worst case. Finally,
we report on an implementation of a simple algorithm for the general case.

diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in multiuser MIMO systems using quantized
feedback, where each user has m transmit antennas and the base-station receiver
has n antennas. We derive an achievable tradeoff and use it to show that in
SNR-symmetric channels, a single bit of imperfect feedback is sufficient to
double the maximum diversity order to 2mn compared to when there is no feedback
(maximum is mn at multiplexing gain of zero). Further, additional feedback bits
do not increase this maximum diversity order beyond 2mn. Finally, the above
diversity order gain of mn over non-feedback systems can also be achieved for
higher multiplexing gains, albeit requiring more than one bit of feedback.

are two sources and $n$ terminals, and (b) $n$ sources and two terminals. In
these cases as long as there exists at least one path from each source to each
terminal we demonstrate that there exists a valid assignment of coding vectors
to the edges such that the terminals can recover the sum of the sources.

when either (a) the observation likelihood (OL) is frequently multimodal or
heavy-tailed, or (b) the state space dimension is large or both. When the OL is
multimodal, but the state transition pdf (STP) is narrow enough, the optimal
importance density is usually unimodal. Under this assumption, many techniques
have been proposed. But when the STP is broad, this assumption does not hold.
We study how existing techniques can be generalized to situations where the
optimal importance density is multimodal, but is unimodal conditioned on a part
of the state vector. Sufficient conditions to test for the unimodality of this
conditional posterior are derived. The number of particles, N, to accurately
track using a PF increases with state space dimension, thus making any regular
PF impractical for large dimensional tracking problems. We propose a solution
that partially addresses this problem. An important class of large dimensional
problems with multimodal OL is tracking spatially varying physical quantities
such as temperature or pressure in a large area using a network of sensors
which may be nonlinear and/or may have non-negligible failure probabilities.

points for simulating a discrete memoryless channel, in which a channel output

common randomness independent of the input is available, the necessary
description rate reduces to Shannon's mutual information. This work
characterizes the optimal tradeoff between the amount of common randomness used

universe detectors to help nodes determine which universe is real. In this

  Theory, Toronto, ON, Canada, July 6 - 11, 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper the advantages provided by multicell processing of signals
transmitted by mobile terminals (MTs) which are received via dedicated relay
terminals (RTs) are studied. It is assumed that each RT is capable of
full-duplex operation and receives the transmission of adjacent relay
terminals. Focusing on intra-cell TDMA and non-fading channels, a simplified
relay-aided uplink cellular model based on a model introduced by Wyner is
considered. Assuming a nomadic application in which the RTs are oblivious to
the MTs' codebooks, a form of distributed compress-and-forward (CF) scheme with
decoder side information is employed. The per-cell sum-rate of the CF scheme is
derived and is given as a solution of a simple fixed point equation. This
achievable rate reveals that the CF scheme is able to completely eliminate the
inter-relay interference, and it approaches a ``cut-set-like'' upper bound for
strong RTs transmission power. The CF rate is also shown to surpass the rate of
an amplify-and-forward scheme via numerical calculations for a wide range of
the system parameters.

  Theory, Toronto, ON, Canada, July 6 - 11, 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium, wireless communication is
susceptible to adversarial eavesdropping. This paper describes how
eavesdropping can potentially be defeated by exploiting the superposition
nature of the wireless medium. A Gaussian wire-tap channel with a helping
interferer (WTC-HI) is considered in which a transmitter sends confidential
messages to its intended receiver in the presence of a passive eavesdropper and
with the help of an interferer. The interferer, which does not know the
confidential message assists the confidential message transmission by sending a
signal that is independent of the transmitted message. An achievable secrecy
rate and a Sato-type upper bound on the secrecy capacity are given for the
Gaussian WTC-HI. Through numerical analysis, it is found that the upper bound
is close to the achievable secrecy rate when the interference is weak for
symmetric interference channels, and under more general conditions for
asymmetric Gaussian interference channels.

mining by Lee and Seung in 1999. NMF attempts to approximate a matrix with
nonnegative entries by a product of two low-rank matrices, also with
nonnegative entries. We propose an algorithm called rank-one downdate (R1D) for
computing a NMF that is partly motivated by singular value decomposition. This
algorithm computes the dominant singular values and vectors of adaptively
determined submatrices of a matrix. On each iteration, R1D extracts a rank-one
submatrix from the dataset according to an objective function. We establish a
theoretical result that maximizing this objective function corresponds to
correctly classifying articles in a nearly separable corpus. We also provide
computational experiments showing the success of this method in identifying
features in realistic datasets.

subject to two kinds of constraints on expected values. The constraints
considered are a constraint on the standard expectation, and a constraint on
the generalized expectation as encountered in nonextensive statistics. The
optimum maximum entropy probability distributions, which can exhibit a
power-law behaviour, are derived and characterized. The R\'enyi entropy of the
optimum distributions can be viewed as a function of the constraint. This
defines two families of entropy functionals in the space of possible expected
values. General properties of these functionals, including nonnegativity,
minimum, convexity, are documented. Their relationships as well as numerical
aspects are also discussed. Finally, we work out some specific cases for the
reference measure $Q(x)$ and recover in a limit case some well-known entropies.

selective-fading multiple-access multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels
and provide corresponding code design criteria. As a byproduct, on the
conceptual level, we find an interesting relation between the DM tradeoff
framework and the notion of dominant error event regions which was first
introduced in the AWGN case by Gallager, IEEE Trans. IT, 1985. This relation
allows to accurately characterize the error mechanisms in MIMO fading
multiple-access channels. In particular, we find that, for a given rate tuple,
the maximum achievable diversity order is determined by the error event that
dominates the total error probability exponentially in SNR. Finally, we show
that the distributed space-time code construction proposed recently by Badr and
Belfiore, Int. Zurich Seminar on Commun., 2008, satisfies the code design
criteria derived in this paper.

recovery of high dimensional sparse signals in three settings: noiseless,
bounded error and Gaussian noise. A unified and elementary treatment is given
in these noise settings for two $\ell_1$ minimization methods: the Dantzig
selector and $\ell_1$ minimization with an $\ell_2$ constraint. The results of
this paper improve the existing results in the literature by weakening the
conditions and tightening the error bounds. The improvement on the conditions
shows that signals with larger support can be recovered accurately. This paper
also establishes connections between restricted isometry property and the
mutual incoherence property. Some results of Candes, Romberg and Tao (2006) and
Donoho, Elad, and Temlyakov (2006) are extended.

of view of algorithmic randomness. In algorithmic information theory, there are
two equivalent ways to define the program-size complexity K(s) of a given
finite binary string s. In the standard way, K(s) is defined as the length of
the shortest input string for the universal self-delimiting Turing machine to
output s. In the other way, the so-called universal probability m is introduced
first, and then K(s) is defined as -log_2 m(s) without reference to the concept
of program-size. In this paper, we investigate the properties of the Shannon
entropy, the power sum, and the Tsallis entropy of a universal probability by
means of the notion of program-size complexity. We determine the convergence or
divergence of each of these three quantities, and evaluate its degree of
randomness if it converges.

non-rigid object given as triangular meshes. We model the morphs as linear
interpolations in a suitable shape space $\mathcal{S}$. For triangulated 3D
polygons, we prove that interpolating linearly in this shape space corresponds
to the most isometric morph in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We then extend this shape space
to arbitrary triangulations in 3D using a heuristic approach and show the
practical use of the approach using experiments. Furthermore, we discuss a
modified shape space that is useful for isometric skeleton morphing. All of the
newly presented approaches solve the morphing problem without the need to solve
a minimization problem.

per node on a two-dimensional (2-D) lattice, asymptotic behavior of a sensor
network deployed over a correlated random field for statistical inference is
investigated. Under a 2-D hidden Gauss-Markov random field model with symmetric
first order conditional autoregression, the behavior of the total information
[nats] and energy efficiency [nats/J] defined as the ratio of total gathered
information to the required energy is obtained as the coverage area, node
density and energy vary.

specification for different types of content has been elaborated to allow
communication of data for the software developed within the European Network of
Excellence &quot;NANOQUANTA&quot;, focusing on first-principles calculations of materials

here in detail. The format relies on the NetCDF binary input/output library,
already used in many different scientific communities, that provides
flexibility as well as portability accross languages and platforms. Thanks to
NetCDF, the content can be accessed by keywords, ensuring the file format is
extensible and backward compatible.

systems using the Distance Based Priority (DBP) scheduler. We first show three
phenomena: (i) choosing, for each task, the initial k-sequence 1^k is not
optimal, (ii) we can even start the scheduling from a (fictive) error state (in
regard to the initial k-sequence) and (iii) the period of feasible
DBP-schedules is not necessarily the task hyper-period. We then show that any
feasible DBP-schedule is periodic and we upper-bound the length of that period.
Lastly, based on our periodicity result we provide an exact schedulability
test.

important task in biological sciences. Given a set of quartet topologies over a
set of taxa, the Maximum Quartet Consistency (MQC) problem consists of
computing a global phylogeny that satisfies the maximum number of quartets. A
number of solutions have been proposed for the MQC problem, including Dynamic
Programming, Constraint Programming, and more recently Answer Set Programming
(ASP). ASP is currently the most efficient approach for optimally solving the
MQC problem. This paper proposes encoding the MQC problem with pseudo-Boolean
(PB) constraints. The use of PB allows solving the MQC problem with efficient
PB solvers, and also allows considering different modeling approaches for the
MQC problem. Initial results are promising, and suggest that PB can be an
effective alternative for solving the MQC problem.

fundamental limits of a specific class of attacks against a particular
cryptosystem. As a first step, the approach is applied on ABSG, which is an
LFSR-based stream cipher where irregular decimation techniques are utilized.
Consequently, under some mild assumptions, which are common in cryptanalysis,
the tight lower bounds on the algorithmic complexity of successful Query-Based
Key-Recovery attacks are derived for two different setups of practical
interest. The proofs rely on the concept of ``typicality'' of information
theory.

the channel state information (CSI) is neither available at the transmitter nor
at the receiver. The optimal capacity-achieving input distribution at low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is precisely characterized, and the exact capacity
of a non-coherent channel is derived. The derived relations allow to better
understanding the capacity of non-coherent channels at low SNR. Then, we
compute the non-coherence penalty and give a more precise characterization of
the sub-linear term in SNR. Finally, in order to get more insight on how the
optimal input varies with SNR, upper and lower bounds on the non-zero mass
point location of the capacity-achieving input are given.

the daily arXiv:astro-ph mailings receive on average significantly more
citations than articles further down the list. In our earlier work we were not
able to decide whether this positional citation effect was due to author
self-promotion of intrinsically more citable papers or whether papers are cited
more often simply because they are at the top of the astro-ph listing. Using
new data we can now disentangle both effects. Based on their submission times
we separate articles into a self-promoted sample and a sample of articles that
achieved a high rank on astro-ph by chance and compare their citation
distributions with those of articles on lower astro-ph positions. We find that
the positional citation effect is a superposition of self-promotion and
visibility bias.

letter from a finite alphabet and an element (&quot;datum&quot;) from an infinite set,
where the latter can only be compared for equality. The article considers
alternating automata on data trees that can move downward and rightward, and
have one register for storing data. The main results are that nonemptiness over
finite data trees is decidable but not primitive recursive, and that
nonemptiness of safety automata is decidable but not elementary. The proofs use
nondeterministic tree automata with faulty counters. Allowing upward moves,
leftward moves, or two registers, each causes undecidability. As corollaries,
decidability is obtained for two data-sensitive fragments of the XPath query
language.

evacuations of buildings, ships, or other enclosed spaces. These offer
sophisticated tools for the study of human behaviour, the recreation of
environmental factors such as fire or smoke, and the inclusion of architectural
or structural features, such as elevators, pillars and exits. Although such
simulation environments can provide insights into crowd behaviour, they lack
the ability to examine potentially dangerous forces building up within a crowd.
These are commonly referred to as crush conditions, and are a common cause of
death in emergency evacuations.
  In this paper, we describe a methodology for the prediction and mitigation of
crush conditions. The paper is organised as follows. We first establish the
need for such a model, defining the main factors that lead to crush conditions,
and describing several exemplar case studies. We then examine current methods
for studying crush, and describe their limitations. From this, we develop a
three-stage hybrid approach, using a combination of techniques. We conclude
with a brief discussion of the potential benefits of our approach.

  Cooperation</title><categories>cs.IT cs.CR math.IT</categories><comments>submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In cellular systems, confidentiality of uplink transmission with respect to
eavesdropping terminals can be ensured by creating intentional inteference via
scheduling of concurrent downlink transmissions. In this paper, this basic idea
is explored from an information-theoretic standpoint by focusing on a two-cell
scenario where the involved base stations are connected via a finite-capacity
backbone link. A number of transmission strategies are considered that aim at
improving uplink confidentiality under constraints on the downlink rate that
acts as an interfering signal. The strategies differ mainly in the way the
backbone link is exploited by the cooperating downlink- to the uplink-operated
base stations. Achievable rates are derived for both the Gaussian (unfaded) and
the fading cases, under different assumptions on the channel state information
available at different nodes. Numerical results are also provided to
corroborate the analysis. Overall, the analysis reveals that a combination of
scheduling and base station cooperation is a promising means to improve
transmission confidentiality in cellular systems.

risk-averseness into the standard 2-stage recourse model, and develop novel
techniques for solving the algorithmic problems arising in these models. A key
notable feature of our work that distinguishes it from work in some other
related models, such as the (standard) budget model and the (demand-) robust
model, is that we obtain results in the black-box setting, that is, where one
is given only sampling access to the underlying distribution. Our first model,
which we call the risk-averse budget model, incorporates the notion of
risk-averseness via a probabilistic constraint that restricts the probability
(according to the underlying distribution) with which the second-stage cost may
exceed a given budget B to at most a given input threshold \rho. We also a
consider a closely-related model that we call the risk-averse robust model,
where we seek to minimize the first-stage cost and the (1-\rho)-quantile of the
second-stage cost.
  We obtain approximation algorithms for a variety of combinatorial
optimization problems including the set cover, vertex cover, multicut on trees,
min cut, and facility location problems, in the risk-averse budget and robust
models with black-box distributions. We obtain near-optimal solutions that
preserve the budget approximately and incur a small blow-up of the probability
threshold (both of which are unavoidable). To the best of our knowledge, these
are the first approximation results for problems involving probabilistic
constraints and black-box distributions. A major component of our results is a
fully polynomial approximation scheme for solving the LP-relaxation of the
risk-averse problem.

noisy channels. We study a particular class of distributed consensus algorithms
based on damped updates, and using the ordinary differential equation method,
we prove that the updates converge almost surely to exact consensus for finite
variance noise. Our analysis applies to various types of stochastic
disturbances, including errors in parameters, transmission noise, and
quantization noise. Under a suitable stability condition, we prove that the
error is asymptotically Gaussian, and we show how the asymptotic covariance is
specified by the graph Laplacian. For additive parameter noise, we show how the
scaling of the asymptotic MSE is controlled by the spectral gap of the
Laplacian.

  open comparative mode</title><categories>cs.OH</categories><comments>20 pages, 10 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This paper describes a new method, HGV2C, for pattern analysis. The HGV2C
method involves the construction of a computer ego (CE) based on an individual
object that can be either a part of the system under analysis or a newly
created object based on a certain hypothesis. The CE provides a capability to
analyze data from a specific standpoint, e.g. from a viewpoint of a certain
object. The CE is constructed from two identical copies of a query object, and
its functioning mechanism involves: a hypothesis-parameter (HP) and
infothyristor (IT). HP is a parameter that is introduced into an existing set
of parameters. The HP value for one of the clones of a query object is set to
equal 1, whereas for another clone it is greater than 1. The IT is based on the
previously described algorithm of iterative averaging and performs three
functions: 1) computation of a similarity matrix for the group of three objects
including two clones of a query object and a target object; 2) division of the
group into two alternative subgroups; and 3) a successive increase of the HP
weight in the totality of all the parameters. Initially, both clones of the
query object appear together in one of the subgroups as all of their parameter
values, except the HP, are identical. At a certain point of the HP
multiplication, one of the clones moves to the group of the target object. A
respective number of the HP multiplications represents the dissimilarity (D)
between the query and target objects. The product of D multiplied by the
difference in HP values of the clones is strictly constant and linearly
increases as the difference in HP values of the clones decreases. This new
approach to knowledge representation is demonstrated on the example of
population pyramids of 220 countries.

get a complex behavior of such merely simple system (system in

theory, are the main topics of this spacious skeleton. Upon this clue, we
organize two algorithms involved a few prominent intelligent computing and
approximate reasoning methods: self organizing feature map (SOM), Neuro- Fuzzy
Inference System and Rough Set Theory (RST). Over this, we show how our
algorithms can be taken as a linkage of government-society interaction, where
government catches various fashions of behavior: solid (absolute) or flexible.
So, transition of such society, by changing of connectivity parameters (noise)
from order to disorder is inferred. Add to this, one may find an indirect
mapping among financial systems and eventual market fluctuations with MACIPS.

model-checking problem for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is either NP-complete or
PSPACE-complete, depending on the set of temporal operators used. If, in
contrast, the set of propositional operators is restricted, the complexity may
decrease. This paper systematically studies the model-checking problem for LTL
formulae over restricted sets of propositional and temporal operators. For
almost all combinations of temporal and propositional operators, we determine
whether the model-checking problem is tractable (in P) or intractable
(NP-hard). We then focus on the tractable cases, showing that they all are
NL-complete or even logspace solvable. This leads to a surprising gap in
complexity between tractable and intractable cases. It is worth noting that our
analysis covers an infinite set of problems, since there are infinitely many
sets of propositional operators.

of outer codes whose code symbols are protected by an inner code. As outer
codes, we assume the most frequently used Reed-Solomon codes; as inner code, we
assume some linear block code which can be decoded up to half its minimum
distance. Decoding up to half the minimum distance of Generalized Concatenated
codes is classically achieved by the Blokh-Zyablov-Dumer algorithm, which
iteratively decodes by first using the inner decoder to get an estimate of the
outer code words and then using an outer error/erasure decoder with a varying
number of erasures determined by a set of pre-calculated thresholds. In this
paper, a modified version of the Blokh-Zyablov-Dumer algorithm is proposed,
which exploits the fact that a number of outer Reed-Solomon codes with average
minimum distance d can be grouped into one single Interleaved Reed-Solomon code
which can be decoded beyond d/2. This allows to skip a number of decoding
iterations on the one hand and to reduce the complexity of each decoding
iteration significantly - while maintaining the decoding performance - on the
other.

Nyquist rate, whilst still allowing near optimal reconstruction of the signal.
In this paper we present a theoretical analysis of the iterative hard
thresholding algorithm when applied to the compressed sensing recovery problem.
We show that the algorithm has the following properties (made more precise in
the main text of the paper)
  - It gives near-optimal error guarantees.
  - It is robust to observation noise.
  - It succeeds with a minimum number of observations.
  - It can be used with any sampling operator for which the operator and its
adjoint can be computed.
  - The memory requirement is linear in the problem size.
  - Its computational complexity per iteration is of the same order as the
application of the measurement operator or its adjoint.
  - It requires a fixed number of iterations depending only on the logarithm of
a form of signal to noise ratio of the signal.
  - Its performance guarantees are uniform in that they only depend on
properties of the sampling operator and signal sparsity.

hidden (black box) binary operation * on S which might come from a group law,
and suppose you have access to an oracle that you can ask for the operation x*y
of single pairs (x,y) you choose. What is the minimal number of queries to the
oracle until the whole binary operation is recovered, i.e. you know x*y for all
x,y in S?
  This problem can trivially be solved by using |S|^2 queries to the oracle, so
the question arises under which circumstances you can succeed with a
significantly smaller number of queries.
  In this presentation we give a lower bound on the number of queries needed
for general binary operations. On the other hand, we present algorithms solving
this problem by using |S| queries, provided that * is an abelian group
operation. We also investigate black box rings and give lower and upper bounds
for the number of queries needed to solve product recovering in this case.

MAC with conferencing encoders. This setting differs from the classical MAC in
that, prior to each transmission block, the two transmitters can communicate
with each other over noise-free bit-pipes of given capacities. The derivation
requires a new technique for proving the optimality of Gaussian input
distributions in certain mutual information maximizations under a Markov
constraint. We also consider a Costa-type extension of the Gaussian MAC with
conferencing encoders. In this extension, the channel can be described as a
two-user MAC with Gaussian noise and Gaussian interference where the
interference is known non-causally to the encoders but not to the decoder. We
show that as in Costa's setting the interference sequence can be perfectly
canceled, i.e., that the capacity region without interference can be achieved.

optical intensity channel. This channel is characterized by inputs that are
nonnegative (representing the transmitted optical intensity) and by outputs
that are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (because in free space the
disturbances arise from many independent sources). Due to battery and safety
reasons the inputs are simultaneously constrained in both their average and
peak power. For a fixed ratio of the average power to the peak power the
difference between the upper and the lower bounds tends to zero as the average
power tends to infinity, and the ratio of the upper and lower bounds tends to
one as the average power tends to zero. The case where only an average-power
constraint is imposed on the input is treated separately. In this case, the
difference of the upper and lower bound tends to 0 as the average power tends
to infinity, and their ratio tends to a constant as the power tends to zero.

for the gathering of data for educational research. WSNs have the capability to
enhance the scope of a researcher to include multiple streams of data:
environmental, location, cyberdata, video, and RFID. The location of data
stored in a database can allow reconstruction of the learning activity for the
evaluation of significance at a later time. A brief overview of the technology

multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems are based on sphere-decoding (SD). The
conventional (and optimum) norm that is used to conduct the tree traversal step
in SD is the l-2 norm. It was, however, recently observed that using the
l-infinity norm instead reduces the hardware complexity of SD considerably at
only a marginal performance loss. These savings result from a reduction in the
length of the critical path in the circuit and the silicon area required for
metric computation, but are also, as observed previously through simulation
results, a consequence of a reduction in the computational (i.e., algorithmic)
complexity. The aim of this paper is an analytical performance and
computational complexity analysis of l-infinity norm SD. For i.i.d. Rayleigh
fading MIMO channels, we show that l-infinity norm SD achieves full diversity
order with an asymptotic SNR gap, compared to l-2 norm SD, that increases at
most linearly in the number of receive antennas. Moreover, we provide a
closed-form expression for the computational complexity of l-infinity norm SD
based on which we establish that its complexity scales exponentially in the
system size. Finally, we characterize the tree pruning behavior of l-infinity
norm SD and show that it behaves fundamentally different from that of l-2 norm
SD.

The
presentation is somewhat unconventional. Indeed I begin with a discussion of
the basic rules of mathematical reasoning and of the notion of proof formalized
in a natural deduction system ``a la Prawitz''. The rest of the material is
more or less traditional but I emphasize partial functions more than usual
(after all, programs may not terminate for all input) and I provide a fairly
complete account of the basic concepts of graph theory.

effects of fading in multi-hop wireless networks, where multiple relay stages
are used by a source to communicate with its destination. This paper proposes a
new distributed space-time block code called the cascaded orthogonal space-time
block code (COSTBC) for the case where the source and destination are equipped
with multiple antennas and each relay stage has one or more single antenna
relays. Each relay stage is assumed to have receive channel state information
(CSI) for all the channels from the source to itself, while the destination is
assumed to have receive CSI for all the channels. To construct the COSTBC,
multiple orthogonal space-time block codes are used in cascade by the source
and each relay stage. In the COSTBC, each relay stage separates the
constellation symbols of the orthogonal space-time block code sent by the
preceding relay stage using its CSI, and then transmits another orthogonal
space-time block code to the next relay stage. COSTBCs are shown to achieve the
maximum diversity gain in a multi-hop wireless network with flat Rayleigh
fading channels. Several explicit constructions of COSTBCs are also provided
for two-hop wireless networks with two and four source antennas and relay
nodes. It is also shown that COSTBCs require minimum decoding complexity thanks
to the connection to orthogonal space-time block codes.

another well-known upper bound for the classical domination in graphs. We also
prove similar upper bounds for the alpha-rate domination number, which combines
the concepts of alpha-domination and k-tuple domination.

Submitted for publication in IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The paper has a threefold purpose. The first purpose is to present an
explicit description of expanded cyclic codes defined in $\GF(q^m)$. The
proposed explicit construction of expanded generator matrix and expanded parity
check matrix maintains the symbol-wise algebraic structure and thus keeps many
important original characteristics. The second purpose of this paper is to
identify a class of constant-weight cyclic codes. Specifically, we show that a
well-known class of $q$-ary BCH codes excluding the all-zero codeword are
constant-weight cyclic codes. Moreover, we show this class of codes achieve the
Plotkin bound. The last purpose of the paper is to characterize expanded cyclic
codes utilizing the proposed expanded generator matrix and parity check matrix.
We characterize the properties of component codewords of a codeword and
particularly identify the precise conditions under which a codeword can be
represented by a subbasis. Our developments reveal an alternative while more
general view on the subspace subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes. With the new
insights, we present an improved lower bound on the minimum distance of an
expanded cyclic code by exploiting the generalized concatenated structure. We
also show that the fixed-rate binary expanded Reed-Solomon codes are
asymptotically &quot;bad&quot;, in the sense that the ratio of minimum distance over code
length diminishes with code length going to infinity. It overturns the
prevalent conjecture that they are &quot;good&quot; codes and deviates from the ensemble
of generalized Reed-Solomon codes which asymptotically achieves the
Gilbert-Varshamov bound.

intelligent computing and approximate reasoning methods: self organizing
feature map (SOM), Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and Rough Set Theory (RST).
Over this, we show how our algorithms can be construed as a linkage of
government-society interaction, where government catches various fashions of
behavior: solid (absolute) or flexible. So, transition of such society, by
changing of connectivity parameters (noise) from order to disorder is inferred.
Add to this, one may find an indirect mapping among financial systems and
eventual market fluctuations with MACIPS.

model to the point cloud of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). We introduce a new
kinetic framework that hides to its user the combinatorial complexity of
determining or maintaining the polyhedron topology, allowing the design of a
simple variational optimization. This new kinetic framework allows the
manipulation of a bounded polyhedron with simple faces by specifying the target
plane equations of each of its faces. It proceeds by evolving continuously from
the polyhedron defined by its initial topology and its initial plane equations
to a polyhedron that is as topologically close as possible to the initial
polyhedron but with the new plane equations. This kinetic framework handles
internally the necessary topological changes that may be required to keep the
faces simple and the polyhedron bounded. For each intermediate configurations
where the polyhedron looses the simplicity of its faces or its boundedness, the
simplest topological modification that is able to reestablish the simplicity
and the boundedness is performed.

and these are: Cultural Genetic Algorithm (CGA), Repulsive Particle Swarm
Optimization (RPSO), Quantum Simulated Annealing (QSA) and the Hybrid method
that combines Genetic Algorithm with Simulated Annealing (HGASA). The results
obtained show that the CGA, QSA and HGASA are able to solve the Sudoku puzzle
with CGA finding a solution in 28 seconds, while QSA finding a solution in 65
seconds and HGASA in 1.447 seconds. This is mainly because HGASA combines the
parallel searching of GA with the flexibility of SA. The RPSO was found to be
unable to solve the puzzle.

proving that a Sturmian word is non-quasiperiodic if and only if it is an
infinite Lyndon word. Here we extend this study to episturmian words (a natural
generalization of Sturmian words) by describing all the quasiperiods of an
episturmian word, which yields a characterization of quasiperiodic episturmian
words in terms of their &quot;directive words&quot;. Even further, we establish a
complete characterization of all episturmian words that are Lyndon words. Our
main results show that, unlike the Sturmian case, there is a much wider class
of episturmian words that are non-quasiperiodic, besides those that are
infinite Lyndon words. Our key tools are morphisms and directive words, in
particular &quot;normalized&quot; directive words, which we introduced in an earlier
paper. Also of importance is the use of &quot;return words&quot; to characterize
quasiperiodic episturmian words, since such a method could be useful in other
contexts.

At first, we derive the
Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) for arbitrary transmitted signals and
arbitrary time-correlation of the disturbance. Then, we investigate design
criteria for the transmitted waveforms in both power-unlimited and
power-limited systems and we study the interplay among the rank of the
optimized code matrix, the number of transmit diversity paths and the amount of
energy integrated along each path. The results show that increasing the rank of
the code matrix allows generating a larger number of diversity paths at the
price of reducing the average signal-to-clutter level along each path.

data-pruning techniques (such as iceberg and top-k queries) are unidimensional.
However, analysts need to issue multidimensional queries. For example, an
analyst may need to select not just the most profitable stores
or--separately--the most profitable products, but simultaneous sets of stores
and products fulfilling some profitability constraints. To fill this need, we
propose a new operator, the diamond dice. Because of the interaction between
dimensions, the computation of diamonds is challenging. We present the first
diamond-dicing experiments on large data sets. Experiments show that we can
compute diamond cubes over fact tables containing 100 million facts in less
than 35 minutes using a standard PC.

order to have their ad shown next to search results for specific keywords.
Currently, the most popular auction for sponsored search is the &quot;Generalized
Second Price&quot; (GSP) auction in which advertisers are assigned to slots in the
decreasing order of their &quot;score,&quot; which is defined as the product of their bid
and click-through rate. In the past few years, there has been significant
research on the game-theoretic issues that arise in an advertiser's interaction
with the mechanism as well as possible redesigns of the mechanism, but this
ranking order has remained standard.
  From a search engine's perspective, the fundamental question is: what is the
best assignment of advertisers to slots? Here &quot;best&quot; could mean &quot;maximizing
user satisfaction,&quot; &quot;most efficient,&quot; &quot;revenue-maximizing,&quot; &quot;simplest to
interact with,&quot; or a combination of these. To answer this question we need to
understand the behavior of a search engine user when she sees the displayed
ads, since that defines the commodity the advertisers are bidding on, and its
value. Most prior work has assumed that the probability of a user clicking on
an ad is independent of the other ads shown on the page.
  We propose a simple Markovian user model that does not make this assumption.
We then present an algorithm to determine the most efficient assignment under
this model, which turns out to be different than that of GSP. A truthful
auction then follows from an application of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
mechanism. Further, we show that our assignment has many of the desirable
properties of GSP that makes bidding intuitive. At the technical core of our
result are a number of insights about the structure of the optimal assignment.

commonly implemented using the protocol FIFO (First In First Out).
Unfortunately, FIFO performs poorly in the Adversarial Queueing Theory. Other
queueing strategies are researched in this model and better results are
performed by alternative queueing strategies, e.g. LIS (Longest In System).
This article introduces a new queueing protocol called interval-strategy that
is concerned with the reduction from dynamic to static routing. We discuss the
maximum system time for a packet and estimate with up-to-date results how this
can be achieved. We figure out the maximum amount of time where a packet can
spend in the network (i.e. worst case system time), and argue that the
universal instability of the presented interval-strategy can be reached through
these results. When a large group of queueing strategies is used for queueing,
we prove that the interval-strategy will be universally unstable. Finally, we
calculate the maximum time of the static routing to reach an universal stable
and polynomial - in detail linear - bounded interval-strategy. Afterwards we
close - in order to check this upper bound - with up-to-date results about the
delivery times in static routing.

security risk for the complete network structure where the node is associated.
Existing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) provide a certain amount of
support for the identification of such infected nodes but suffer from the need
of plenty of communication and computational power. In this article, we present
a novel approach called AGNOSCO to support the identification of infected nodes
through the usage of artificial ant colonies. It is shown that AGNOSCO
overcomes the communication and computational power problem while identifying
infected nodes properly.

  INFOCOM 2007</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This work investigates three aspects: (a) a network vulnerability as the
non-uniform vulnerable-host distribution, (b) threats, i.e., intelligent
malwares that exploit such a vulnerability, and (c) defense, i.e., challenges
for fighting the threats. We first study five large data sets and observe
consistent clustered vulnerable-host distributions. We then present a new
metric, referred to as the non-uniformity factor, which quantifies the
unevenness of a vulnerable-host distribution. This metric is essentially the
Renyi information entropy and better characterizes the non-uniformity of a
distribution than the Shannon entropy. Next, we analyze the propagation speed
of network-aware malwares in view of information theory. In particular, we draw
a relationship between Renyi entropies and randomized epidemic malware-scanning
algorithms. We find that the infection rates of malware-scanning methods are
characterized by the Renyi entropies that relate to the information bits in a
non-unform vulnerable-host distribution extracted by a randomized scanning
algorithm. Meanwhile, we show that a representative network-aware malware can
increase the spreading speed by exactly or nearly a non-uniformity factor when
compared to a random-scanning malware at an early stage of malware propagation.
This quantifies that how much more rapidly the Internet can be infected at the
early stage when a malware exploits an uneven vulnerable-host distribution as a
network-wide vulnerability. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of
defense strategies on the spread of network-aware malwares. Our results
demonstrate that counteracting network-aware malwares is a significant
challenge for the strategies that include host-based defense and IPv6.

interpreting formulas as games on which proofs induce strategies. In this
article, we introduce a game semantics for a fragment of first order
propositional logic. One of the main difficulties that has to be faced when
constructing such semantics is to make them precise by characterizing definable
strategies - that is strategies which actually behave like a proof. This
characterization is usually done by restricting to the model to strategies
satisfying subtle combinatory conditions such as innocence, whose preservation
under composition is often difficult to show. Here, we present an original
methodology to achieve this task which requires to combine tools from game
semantics, rewriting theory and categorical algebra. We introduce a
diagrammatic presentation of definable strategies by the means of generators
and relations: those strategies can be generated from a finite set of
``atomic'' strategies and that the equality between strategies generated in
such a way admits a finite axiomatization. These generators satisfy laws which
are a variation of bialgebras laws, thus bridging algebra and denotational
semantics in a clean and unexpected way.

- e.g. classifiers or rule-based firewall systems to detect intrusions and
anomalies and to secure a network against viruses, worms, or trojans. However,
these network systems rely on individuality and support an architecture with
less collaborative work of the protection components. They give less
administration support for maintenance, but offer a large number of individual
single points of failures - an ideal situation for network attacks to succeed.
In this work, we discuss the required features, the performance, and the
problems of a distributed protection system called SANA. It consists of a
cooperative architecture, it is motivated by the human immune system, where the
components correspond to artificial immune cells that are connected for their
collaborative work. SANA promises a better protection against intruders than
common known protection systems through an adaptive self-management while
keeping the resources efficiently by an intelligent reduction of redundant
tasks. We introduce a library of several novel and common used protection
components and evaluate the performance of SANA by a proof-of-concept
implementation.

components, which are directly installed in the operating system. These check
the whole node for suspicious behaviour. Armouring intrusions e.g. have the
ability to hide themselves from being checked. We present in this paper an
alternative organisation of security systems. The node is completely
virtualized with current virtualization systems so that the operating system
with applications and the security system is distinguished. The security system
then checks the node from outside and the right security components are
provided through a service oriented architecture. Due to the running in a
virtual machine, the infected nodes can be halted, duplicated, and moved to
other nodes for further analysis and legal aspects. This organisation is in
this article analysed and a preliminary implementation showing promising
results are discussed.

the system and place it in some arbitrary global state, the systems recovers
from this catastrophic situation without external intervention in finite time.
Unidirectional networks preclude many common techniques in self-stabilization
from being used, such as preserving local predicates. In this paper, we
investigate the intrinsic complexity of achieving self-stabilization in
unidirectional networks, and focus on the classical vertex coloring problem.
When deterministic solutions are considered, we prove a lower bound of $n$
states per process (where $n$ is the network size) and a recovery time of at
least $n(n-1)/2$ actions in total. We present a deterministic algorithm with
matching upper bounds that performs in arbitrary graphs. When probabilistic
solutions are considered, we observe that at least $\Delta + 1$ states per
process and a recovery time of $\Omega(n)$ actions in total are required (where
$\Delta$ denotes the maximal degree of the underlying simple undirected graph).
We present a probabilistically self-stabilizing algorithm that uses
$\mathtt{k}$ states per process, where $\mathtt{k}$ is a parameter of the
algorithm. When $\mathtt{k}=\Delta+1$, the algorithm recovers in expected
$O(\Delta n)$ actions. When $\mathtt{k}$ may grow arbitrarily, the algorithm
recovers in expected O(n) actions in total. Thus, our algorithm can be made
optimal with respect to space or time complexity.

or components. Especially in micro fluidics a lotus-like characteristic is
requested for many applications. Structure details with a high aspect ratio are
necessary to decouple the bottom and the top of the functional layer. Unlike to
stochastic methods, patterning with a LIGA-mold insert it is possible to
structure surfaces very uniformly or even with controlled variations (e.g. with
gradients). In this paper we present the process chain to realize polymer
sub-micro structures with minimum lateral feature size of 400 nm and up to 4
micrometers high.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2008, Nice : France (2008)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The need for wearable or abandoned microsystems, as well as the trend to a
lower power consumption of electronic devices, make miniaturized renewable
energy generators a viable alternative to batteries. Among the different
alternatives, an interesting option is the use of inertial microgenerators for
energy scavenging from vibrations present in the environment. These devices
constitute perpetual energy sources without the need for refilling, thus being
well suited for abandoned sensors, wireless systems or microsystems which must
be embedded within the structure, without outside physical connections.
Different electromagnetic energy scavenging devices have been described in the
literature [1,2,3], based on the use of a velocity damped resonator, which is
well suited for harvesting of vibrational energy induced by the operation of
machines. These vibrations are characterized by a well defined frequency (in
the range between few Hz's and few kHz's) and low displacement amplitudes.
Adjusting the resonant frequency of the system to that of the vibrations allows
amplification of these low amplitude displacements. Moreover, for these
applications, the use of an electromagnetic device has the potential advantages
of a good level of compatibility with Si Microsystem technology, as well as the
possibility of relatively high electromechanical coupling with simple designs.

the effects of the diaphragm thickness and stress, the air-gap thickness, and
the area ratio of acoustic holes to backplate on the sensitivity of the
condenser microphone have been demonstrated since the performance of the
microphone depends on these parameters. The microphone diaphragm has been
designed with a diameter and thickness of 1.9 mm and 0.6 $\mu$m, respectively,
an air-gap thickness of 10 $\mu$m, and a 24% area ratio of acoustic holes to
backplate. To obtain a lower initial stress, the material used for the
diaphragm is polyimide. The measured sensitivities of the microphone at the
bias voltages of 24 V and 12 V are -45.3 and -50.2 dB/Pa (at 1 kHz),
respectively. The fabricated microphone shows a flat frequency response
extending to 20 kHz.

produce a cheap, reliable, low-power and CMOS-MEMS process compatible
capacitive type relative humidity (RH) sensor that can be incorporated into a
state-of-the-art, wireless sensor network. In this paper we discuss the
preparation of our new capacitive structure based on post-CMOS MEMS processes
and the methods which were used to characterize the thin film porous alumina
sensing layer. The average sensitivity is approx. 15 pF/RH% which is more than
a magnitude higher than the values found in the literature. The sensor is
equipped with integrated resistive heating, which can be used for maintenance
to reduce drift, or for keeping the sensing layer at elevated temperature, as
an alternative method for temperature-dependence cancellation.

of a nanoparticle silver seed layer followed by selective electroless copper
deposition. Silver ions were first incorporated into a hydrolyzed polyimide
surface layer by wet chemical treatment. A photoreactive polymer coating,
methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) was coated on top of the substrate prior
to UV irradiation. Electrons released through the interaction between the MPEG
molecules and UV photons allowed the reduction of the silver ions across the
MPEG/doped polyimide interface. The resultant silver seed layer has a cluster
morphology which is suitable for the initiation of electroless plating. Initial
results showed that the deposited copper tracks were in good agreement with the
track width on the photomask and laser direct-writing can also fabricate
smaller line width metal tracks with good accuracy. The facile fabrication
presented here can be carried out in air, at atmospheric pressure, and on
contoured surfaces.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2008, Nice : France (2008)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Multilayered ceramic substrates with embedded micro patterns are becoming
increasingly important, for example, in harsh environment electronics and
microfluidic devices. Fabrication of these embedded micro patterns, such as
micro channels, cavities and vias, is a challenge. This study focuses on the
process of patterning micro features on ceramic green substrates using micro
embossing. A ceramic green tape that possessed near-zero shrinkage in the x-y
plane was used, six layers of which were laminated as the embossing substrate.
The process parameters that impact on the pattern fidelity were investigated
and optimized in this study. Micro features with line-width as small as several
micrometers were formed on the ceramic green substrates. The dynamic
thermo-mechanical analysis indicated that extending the holding time at certain
temperature range would harden the green substrates with little effect on
improving the embossing fidelity. Ceramic substrates with embossed micro
patterns were obtain d after co-firing. The embedded micro channels were also
obtained by laminating the green tapes on the embossed substrates.

secondary properties of the structure which correspond to special behavior
because these properties can not be easily derived from the main

Mechanical properties of MEMS structures depend not only on the bulk material
properties, but also structural factors. A measurement system has been made to
measure force/deflection on microstructures to examine some of the structural
properties. This is a stylus setup integrated with a load cell and a linear
actuator. First, the requirements for the measurement system were established.
Then the system was built up and characterized. We have successfully made
measurements on a typical micromechanical structure, a cantilever accelerometer
design. The stylus placement accuracy, the spring constant along the proof
mass, analysis of the force/deflection curve shape and destructive tests on the
cantilever have been investigated in our experiment and will be presented in
this paper.

characterization of a high temperature test chamber will be introduced. The
test chamber is used for fatigue testing of different MEMS devices where the
homogenous temperature distribution within the close proximity from the heating

temperature distribution inside the test chamber. In order to achieve smaller
time constant a new contactless sensor card was developed. The contactless
thermal characterization method introduced in this paper enables in situ heat
distribution measurement inside the test chamber during operation, with the
detection of potentially uneven heat distribution.

parameters on electrodeposit characteristics for the production of nickel (Ni)

on the most relevant parameter for industry, which is the current density,
because it determines the process time and the consumed energy. The results of
the Ni and Ni-Fe characterisations can be divided into two aspects closely
linked with each other ; the morphology and the hardness.

fabrication of a micro probe using a complex nontraditional machining process.
A series process was combined to machine tungsten carbide rods from original
dimension. The original dimension of tungsten carbide rods was 3mm ; the rods
were ground to a fixed-dimension of 50 micrometers using precision grinding
machine in first step. And then, the rod could be machined to a
middle-dimension of 20 micrometers by electrolysis. A final desired micro
dimension can be achieved using supersonic aided electrolysis.
High-aspect-ratio of micro tungsten carbide rod was easily obtained by this
process. Surface roughness of the sample with supersonic aided agitation was
compared with that with no agitation in electrolysis. The machined surface of
the sample is very smooth due to ionized particles of anode could be removed by
supersonic aided agitation during electrolysis. Deep micro holes can also be
achieved by the machined high-aspect-rati tungsten carbide rod using EDM
process. A micro probe of a ball shape at the end was processed by proposed
supersonic aided electrolysis machining process.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2008, Nice : France (2008)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper, we will report our achievements in developing large area
patterning of multilayered ceramic green composites using roller embossing. The
aim of our research is to pattern large area ceramic green composites using a
modified roller laminating apparatus, which is compatible with screen printing
machines, for integration of embossing and screen printing. The instrumentation
of our roller embossing apparatus, as shown in Figure1, consists of roller 1
and rollers 2. Roller 1 is heated up to the desired embossing temperature ;
roller 2 is, however, kept at room temperature. The mould is a nickel template
manufactured by plating nickel-based micro patterns (height : 50 $\mu$m) on a
nickel film (thickness : 70 $\mu$m) ; the substrate for the roller embossing is
a multilayered Heraeus Heralock HL 2000 ceramic green composite. Comparing with
the conventional simultaneous embossing, the advantages of roller embossing
include : (1) low embossing force ; (2) easiness of demoulding ; (3) localized
area in contact with heater ; and etc. We have demonstrated the capability of
large area roller embossing with a panel size of 150mmx 150mm on the mentioned
substrate. We have explored and confirmed the impact of parameters (feed speed,
temperature of roller and applied pressure) to the pattern quality of roller
embossing. Furthermore, under the optimized process parameters, we
characterized the variations of pattern dimension over the panel area, and
calculated a scaling factor in order to make the panel compatible with other
processes. Figure 2 shows the embossed patterns on a 150mmx 150mm green ceramic
panel.

simulate micro embossing process and investigate the thermo-mechanical response
of ceramic green substrates. The laminated low temperature co-fired ceramic
green tapes were used as the testing material ; the correlations of indentation
depth versus applied force and applied stress at the temperatures of 25 degrees
C and 75degrees C were studied. The results showed that permanent indentation
cavities could be formed at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 75
degrees C, and the depth of cavities created was applied force, temperature and
dwell time dependent. Creep occurred and made a larger contribution to the
plastic deformation at elevated temperatures and high peak loads. There was
instantaneous recovery during the unloading and retarded recovery in the first
day after indentation. There was no significant pile-up due to material flow
observed under compression at the temperature up to 75 degrees C. The plastic
deformation was the main cause for formation of cavity on the ceramic green
substrate under compression. The results can be used as a guideline for
embossing ceramic green substrates.

of energy supply. Energy scavenging, i.e. collecting energy from the ambient
environment has been developed to answer this problematic. Various sources have
already been successfully used (solar, vibration). This article presents
temporal variations of temperature as a new source of exploitable energy. A
brief review will take place at the beginning, exposing the different

of magnetism and piezoelectricity. A new kind of thermal generator is proposed
and a preliminary model is exposed. Conclusions will be drawn on the
suitability of this prototype and the improvements that are needed to increase
its potential.

simulated using a circuit simulator. Both linear and nonlinear models are
investigated. The nonlinear model includes mechanical stoppers at the
displacement extremes. Large amplitude excitation signals, both narrow and wide
band, are used to emulate environmental vibrations. Nonlinear behavior is
significant at large displacement due to the impact on mechanical stoppers. For
a sinusoidal excitation the mechanical stoppers cause the output power to
flatten and weakly decrease. For a wide band excitation, the output power first
increases linearly with the power spectral density of the input signal, then
grows slower than linearly.

to numerous studies, but are still facing major issues relating to their
conditioning circuit. One of the most popular ones uses a charge pump and a
flyback circuit based on a Buck DC-DC converter (Fig. 1). A commutation between
the energy accumulation in the charge pump and the recharge of the buffer
capacitor Cres is assured by a switch which is the major bottleneck in the
energy harvester circuit. The commutation timing of the switch determines the
efficiency of the energy harvesting. In previous papers [1] the switch
commutates periodically with some fixed duty ratio. However, this solution is
not appropriate when the environment parameters, e.g. the vibration frequency,
change. We found that the switching should be ordered by the internal state of
the circuit, an not by some fixed timing scenario. We presents how to find the
optimal operation mode of the harvester. To validate the study, the system was
modeled using a mixed VHDL-AMS - ELDO model.

and biocompatible materials. Nanostructured PLGA even has great application
potentials in tissue engineering. In this research, a fabrication technique for
nanostructured PLGA membrane was investigated and developed. In this novel
fabrication approach, an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) film was use as the
template ; the PLGA solution was then cast on it ; the vacuum air-extraction
process was applied to transfer the nano porous pattern from the AAO membrane
to the PLGA membrane and form nanostures on it. The cell culture experiments of
the bovine endothelial cells demonstrated that the nanostructured PLGA membrane
can double the cell growing rate. Compared to the conventional chemical-etching
process, the physical fabrication method proposed in this research not only is
simpler but also does not alter the characteristics of the PLGA. The
nanostructure of the PLGA membrane can be well controlled by the AAO temperate.

rapid fluidic mixing and reaction, named a SNR micro-reactor, was designed,
fabricated and systematically analyzed. This SNR micro-reactor possessing an
in-plane dividing structure requires only simple fabrication. We investigated
this reactor and compared it numerically and experimentally with a
slanted-groove micromixer (SGM). From the numerical results the mixing indices
and mixing patterns demonstrated that the mixing ability of the SNR
micro-reactor was much superior to that of the SGM. From a mixing test with
phenolphthalein and sodium hydroxide solutions, the mixing lengths of the SNR
micro-reactor were less than 4 mm for a Reynolds number over a wide range (Re =
0.1 - 10). From a comparison of mixing lengths, the results revealed also that
the SNR micro-reactor surpassed the SGM in mixing performance by more than 200
%. As a reaction length is a suitable test of the performance of a reactor, we
introduced a redox reaction between ascorbic acid and iodine solutions to
assess the reaction capability of these micro devices ; the reaction lengths of
the SNR micro-reactor were much shorter than those of a SGM. The SNR
micro-reactor has consequently a remarkable efficiency for fluid mixing and
reaction.

living cell and embryo, is fundamental needed to many biological and medical
applications. The insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) trapping is composed
of conductless tetragon structures in micro-chip. In this study, a lower
conductive material of photoresist was adopted as a structure in open-top
microchannel instead of a metallic wire to squeeze the electric field in a
conducting solution, therefore, creating a high field gradient with a local
maximum. The microchip with the open-top microchannels was designed and
fabricated herein. The insulator-based DEP trapping microchip with the open-top
microchannels was designed and fabricated in this work. The cells trapped by
DEP force could be further treated or cultured in the open-top microchannel ;
however, those trapped in the microchip with enclosed microchannels could not
be proceeded easily.

peristaltic micro-pump. The valve-less peristaltic micro-pump with three
membrane chambers in a serial is actuated by three piezoelectric (PZT)
actuators. With the fluidic flow design, liquid in the flow channel is pumped
to a constant flow speed ranged from 0.4 to 0.48 mm/s. In term of the maximum
flow rate of the micro-pump is about 365 mircoliters/min, when the applied
voltage is 24V and frequency 50 Hz. Photolithography process was used to
fabricate the micro-pump mold. PDMS molding and PDMS bonding method were used
to fabricate the micro-channel and actuator chambers. A portable drive
controller was designed to control three PZT actuators in a proper sequence to
drive the chamber membrane. Then, all parts were integrated into the portable
valve-less peristaltic micro-pump system.

blood cells from blood under contionous flow. The separation method consist of
continous flow of a blood sample (diluted in PBS) through a microfluidic
channel which presents on the bottom &quot;dots&quot; of feromagnetic layer. By appling a
magnetic field perpendicular on the flowing direction, the feromagnetic &quot;dots&quot;
generates a gradient of magnetic field which amplifies the magnetic force. As a
result, the red blood cells are captured on the bottom of the microfluidic
channel while the rest of the blood is collected at the outlet. Experimental
results show that an average of 95 % of red blood cells are trapped in the
device

microfluidic channels enables the pneumatic actuation of valves within bonded
PMMA-PDMS-PMMA multilayer devices. Here, surface functionalization of PMMA
substrates via acid catalyzed hydrolysis and air plasma corona treatment were
investigated as possible techniques to permanently bond PMMA microfluidic
channels to PDMS surfaces. FTIR and water contact angle analysis of
functionalized PMMA substrates showed that air plasma corona treatment was most
effective in inducing PMMA hydrophilicity. Subsequent fluidic tests showed that
air plasma modified and bonded PMMA multilayer devices could withstand fluid
pressure at an operational flow rate of 9 mircoliters/min. The pneumatic
actuation of the embedded PDMS membrane was observed through optical microscopy
and an electrical resistance based technique. PDMS membrane actuation occurred
at pneumatic pressures of as low as 10kPa and complete valving occurred at
14kPa for 100 micrometers x 100 micrometers channel cross-sections.

microactuator have been developed. These models are based on electro thermal
and thermo mechanical analysis of the microbeam. Also, Finite Element Analysis
(FEA) is used to evaluate microactuator tip deflection. Analytical and Finite
Element results are compared with experimental results in literature and show
good agreement in low input voltages. A dimensional variation of beam lengths,
beam lengths ratios and gap are introduced in analytical and FEA models to
explore microactuator performance. An electrothermally driven polysilicon
microactuator similar to Pan's actuator architecture has been studied in this
paper. This microactuator generates deflection through asymmetric heating of
the hot and cold polysilicon arms with different lengths. For this
microactuator architecture, an optimal beam length ratio equal to 0.46 has been
obtained to achieve maximum tip deflection. . As it was expected, the results
show decreasing air gap increase microactuator tip deflection. It is also found
that for microactuators with longer hot arms, microactuator tip deflections are
more sensitive to beam length ratios and air gap.

mechanical memory point. The structure is composed of a suspended slender
nanowire (width : 100nm, thickness 430nm length : 8 to 30$\mu$m) clamped at its
both ends. Electrodes are placed on each sides of the nanowire and are used to
actuate the structure (writing, erasing) and to measure the position through a
capactive bridge (reading). The structure is patterned by electron beam
lithography on a pre-stressed thermally grown silicon dioxide layer. When later
released, the stressed material relaxes and the beam buckles in a position of
lower energy. Such symmetric beams, called Euler beams, show two stable
deformed positions thus form a bistable structure. This paper will present the
fabrication, simulation and mechanical and electrical actuation of an in plane
bistable nanowire. Final paper will include a section on FEM simulations.

silicon-rich silicon-nitride microchannels with an integrated Al/poly-Si++
thermopile in combination with up- and downstream Al heater resistors. The
inherently zero offset of the thermopile is exploited in a feedback loop
controlling the dissipated power in the heater resistors, eliminating
inevitable influences of resistance drift and mismatch of the thin-film metal
resistors. The control system cancels the flow-induced temperature difference
across the thermopile by controlling a power difference between both heater
resistors, thereby giving a measure for the flow rate. The flow sensor was
characterised for power difference versus water flow rates up to 1.5 ul/min,
being in good agreement with a thermal model of the sensor, and the correct
low-drift operation of the temperature-balancing control system has been
verified.

capable of detecting and measuring two independent gas flows with a single
chip, is described. The device is based on a 4 x 4 mm2 silicon chip, where a
series of differential micro-anemometers have been integrated together with
standard electronic components by means of postprocessing techniques. The
innovative aspect of the sensor is the use of a plastic adapter, thermally
bonded to the chip, to convey the gas flow only to the areas where the sensors
are located. The use of this inexpensive packaging procedure to include
different sensing structures in distinct flow channels is demonstrated.

test structures are compared with damping coefficients given by published
compact models. The motion of the perforated plates is almost translational,
the surface shape is rectangular, and the perforation is uniform validating the
assumptions made for compact models. In the structures, the perforation ratio
varies from 24% - 59%. The study of the structure shows that the
compressibility and inertia do not contribute to the damping at the frequencies
used (130kHz - 220kHz). The damping coefficients given by all four compact
models underestimate the measured damping coefficient by approximately 20%. The
reasons for this underestimation are discussed by studying the various flow
components in the models.

predict the coupled behaviour of microbeams for out-of-plane bending tests is
performed. This work completes a previous investigation concerning in plane
microbeams bending. Often out-of-plane microcantilevers and clamped-clamped
microbeams suffer the presence of residual strain and stress, which affect the
value of pull-in voltage. In case of microcantilever an accurate modelling
includes the effect of the initial curvature due to microfabrication. In double
clamped microbeams a preloading applied by tensile stress is considered.
Geometrical onlinearity caused by mechanical coupling between axial and
flexural behaviour is detected and modelled. Experimental results demonstrate a
good agreement between FEM approaches proposed and tests. A fairly fast and
accurate prediction of pull-in condition is performed, thus numerical models
can be used to identify residual stress in microbridges by reverse analysis
from the measured value of pull-in voltage.

Effectiveness of plane models to predict pull-in in presence of geometric

is investigated. The paper is aimed to discuss the capability of 2D models to
be used as compact tools to substitute some model order reduction techniques,
which appear unsuitable in presence of both electromechanical and geometric
nonlinearities.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2008, Nice : France (2008)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The technique of laser-assisted nanoimprinting lithography (LAN) has been
proposed to utilize an excimer laser to irradiate through a quartz mold and
melts a thin polymer film on the substrate for micro- to nano-scaled
fabrications. In the present study, the novel concept of that copper was
adopted as the substrate instead of silicon, which is conventionally used, was
proposed. The micro/nano structures on the copper substrate could be fabricated
by chemical/electrochemical etching or electroforming ; following by the
patterns have been transferred onto the substrate using LAN process.
Alternatives of the substrate materials could lead versatile applications in
micro/nano-fabrication. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept
numerically, this study introduced optical multiple reflection theory to
perform both analytical and numerical modeling during the process and to
predict the thermal response theoretically.

using micro-electroforming process for mini-DMFC (direct methanol fuel cell)
stacks. Ultraviolet (UV) lithography was used to define micro-fluidic channels
using a photomask and exposure process. Micro-fluidic channels mold with 300
micrometers thick and 500 micrometers wide were firstly fabricated in a
negative photoresist onto a stainless steel plate. Copper micro-electroforming
was used to replicate the micro-fluidic channels mold. Following by sputtering
silver (Ag) with 1.2 micrometers thick, the metallic bipolar plates were
completed. The silver layer is used for corrosive resistance. The completed
mini-DMFC stack is a 2x2 cm2 fuel cell stack including a 1.5x1.5 cm2 MEA
(membrane electrode assembly). Several MEAs were assembly into mini-DMFC stacks
using the completed metallic bipolar plates. All test results showed the
metallic bipolar plates suitable for mini-DMFC stacks. The maximum output power
density is 9.3mW/cm2 and current density is 100 mA/cm2 when using 8 vol. %
methanol as fuel and operated at temperature 30 degrees C. The output power
result is similar to other reports by using conventional graphite bipolar
plates. However, conventional graphite bipolar plates have certain difficulty
to be machined to such micro-fluidic channels. The proposed
micro-electroforming metallic bipolar plates are feasible to miniaturize DMFC
stacks for further portable 3C applications.

microlens array using the proximity printing in lithography process is
reported. The technology utilizes the UV proximity printing by controlling a
printing gap between the mask and substrate. The designed approximate triangle
microlens array pattern can be fabricated the high fill-factor triangular
microlens array in photoresist. It is due to the UV light diffraction to
deflect away from the aperture edges and produce a certain exposure in
photoresist material outside the aperture edges. This method can precisely
control the geometric profile of high fill factor triangular microlens array.
The experimental results showed that the triangular micro-lens array in
photoresist could be formed automatically when the printing gap ranged from 240
micrometers to 840 micrometers. The gapless triangular microlens array will be
used to increases of luminance for backlight module of liquid crystal displays.

large-displacement, gentle handling force, low-power MEMS actuators. Potential
applications of these devices are micro-relays, assembling and miniature
medical instrumentation. In this paper the development of thermal
microactuators based on SU-8 polymer is described. The paper presents the
development of a new microgripper which can realize a movement of the gripping
arms with possibility for positioning and manipulating of the gripped object.
Two models of polymeric microgripper electrothermo- mechanical actuated, using
low actuation voltages, designed for SU-8 polymer fabrication were presented.
The electro-thermal microgrippers were designed and optimized using finite
element simulations. Electro-thermo-mechanical simulations based on finite
element method were performed for each of the model in order to compare the
results. Preliminary experimental tests were carried out.

Experiments are further conducted to fabricate the designed micro lens array by
the thermal reflow process. The formed profile is then sputtered with copper to
serve as the mold. The front and the rear micro lens array are fabricated by
plating PDMS to the mold and then assembled to form the designed micro lens

one-dimensional thermal inclinometer with the cavity filled of gas and liquid.
The sensor principle consists of one heating resistor placed between two
detectors. When the resistor is electrically powered, it creates a symmetrical
temperature profile inside a micromachined silicon cavity. By applying a tilt
to the sensor, the profile shifts in the same direction of the sensible axis
corresponding to the horizontal one to one. The temperature profile and the
sensitivity according to the CO2 gas and mineral oil SAE50 have been studied
using numerical resolution of fluid dynamics equations with the computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) software package Fluent V6.2. We have shown that the
sensitivity of liquid sensors is higher than the gas sensors one. By using
micromachined silicon technique, a thermal inclinometer with one pair of
detectors placed at 300 um from the heater has been made. Experimental
measurements corroborate with the numerical simulation.

temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrates by integrating micro inkjetting
with electroless plating. Micro inkjetting was realized by using an inkjetting
printer that ejects ink droplets from a printhead. This printhead consists of a
glass nozzle with a diameter of 50 micrometers and a piezoelectric transducer
that is coated on the nozzle. The silver colloidal solution was inkjetted on a
sintered CT800 ceramic substrate, followed by curing at 200 degrees C for 60
minutes. As a result, the silver trace with a thickness of 200 nm was obtained.
The substrate, with the ejected silver thin film as the seed layer, was then
immersed into a preinitiator solution to coat a layer of palladium for
enhancing the deposition of nickel. Electroless nickel plating was successfully
conducted at a rate of 0.39 micrometers /min, and the thickness of traces was
plated up to 84 micrometers. This study demonstrates that the integration of
inkjetting with plating is an effective method to form high aspect patterns at
the demand location.

probe on the GaAs wafer was studied. A waveguide was introduced by evaporating
Au film on the top and bottom surfaces of the GaAs AFM probe. A tip having 8
micrometers high, and curvature radius about 50 nm was formed. The dimensions
of the cantilever are 250x30x15 micrometers. The open structure of the
waveguide at the tip of the probe was introduced by using FIB fabrication. AFM
topography of a grating sample was measured by using the fabricated GaAs
microwave probe. The fabricated probe was found having nanometer scale
resolution, and microwave emission was detected successfully at the tip of the
probe by approaching Cr-V steel and Au wire samples.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2008, Nice : France (2008)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  For a set of operating conditions and coating color formulations, undesirable
phenomena like color spitting and coating ribs may be triggered in the
Micro-nip during the coating process. Therefore, our interest in this work
focus on another parameter affect on the undesirable phenomena as the vortices
in the Micro-nip. The problem deals with the flow through the Micro-nip of
metering size press. The flow enters and exits at a tangential velocity of 20
m/s between two rollers with diameter 80 cm and 60 -m apart. In the upper and
bottom part of the domain the angular velocity is 314 rad /s. It has one
sub-domain. Previous studies focus on the Micro-nip without considering the
inertia and the viscoelasticity of the material. Roll coating is a technique
commonly used in the coating industry to meter a thin fluid film on a moving
substrate. During the film formation, the fluid is subjected to very high shear
and extensional rates over a very short period of time. The fluid domain
changes as a function of the hydrodynamic pressure within the nip as a result
of the deformable cover usually used on one of the rolls. The free surface also
adds more complexity to the flow due to the force equilibrium in the fluid gas
interface. Last of all, the rheological behavior of the coating fluid is
usually non-Newtonian, so the metering flow hydrodynamics is finally very
difficult to describe. It is concluded that the normal forces of micro-nip
increases with increasing the inhibitors. Therefore, it affects on the
smoothness and creates defects. On the other hand, it can be concluded that the
creation of big vortex in the middle of micro-nip affects on the coating liquid
behavior.

causes cantilever beams to bend for manufacturing a micro-structured gas flow
sensor. This study uses a silicon wafer deposited silicon nitride layers,
reassembled the gas flow sensor with four cantilever beams that perpendicular
to each other and manufactured piezoresistive structure on each
micro-cantilever by MEMS technologies, respectively. When the cantilever beams
are formed after etching the silicon wafer, it bends up a little due to the
released residual stress induced in the previous fabrication process. As air
flows through the sensor upstream and downstream beam deformation was made,
thus the airflow direction can be determined through comparing the resistance
variation between different cantilever beams. The flow rate can also be
measured by calculating the total resistance variations on the four
cantilevers.

nano-scale thin metal films on substrate is presented. The test structure was
designed on a novel &quot;paddle&quot; cantilever beam specimens with dimensions as few
hundred nanometers to less than 10 nanometers. This beam is in triangle shape
in order to provide uniform plane strain distribution. Standard clean room
processing was used to prepare the paddle sample. The experiment can be
operated by using the electrostatic deflection on the paddle uniform
distributed stress cantilever beam and then measure the deposited thin metal
film materials on top of it. A capacitance technique was used to measurement on
the other side of the deflected plate to measure its deflection with respect to
the force. The measured strain was converted through the capacitance
measurement for the deflection of the cantilever. System performance on the
residual stress measurement of thin films are calculated with three different
forces on the &quot;paddle&quot; cantilever beam, including the force due to the film,
compliance force and electrostatic force.

CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) process and a post-process. The
spiral inductor is manufactured on silicon substrate using the 0.35 micrometers
CMOS process. In order to reduce the substrate loss and enhance the Q-factor of
the inductor, silicon substrate under the inductor is removed using a
post-process. The post-process uses RIE (reactive ion etching) to etch the
sacrificial layer of silicon dioxide, and then TMAH (tetra methyl ammonium
hydroxide) is employed to remove the underlying silicon substrate and obtain
the suspended spiral inductor. The advantage of the post process is compatible
with the CMOS process. The Agilent 8510C network analyzer and a Cascade probe
station are used to measure the performances of the spiral inductor.
Experiments indicate that the spiral inductor has a Q-factor of 15 at 11 GHz,
an inductance of 4 nH at 25.5 GHz and a self-resonance frequency of about 27
GHz.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2008, Nice : France (2008)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Two dimensional (2D) integration has been the traditional approach for IC
integration. Due to increasing demands for providing electronic devices with
superior performance and functionality in more efficient and compact packages,
has driven the semiconductor industry to develop more advanced packaging
technologies. Three-dimensional (3D) approaches address both miniaturization
and integration required for advanced and portable electronic products.
Vertical integration proved to be essential in achieving a greater integration
flexibility of disparate technologies, reason for which a general trend of
transition from 2D to 3D integration is currently being observed in the
industry. 3D chip integration using through silicon via (TSV) copper is
considered one of the most advanced technologies among all different types of
3D packaging technologies. Copper electrodeposition is one of technologies that
enable the formation of TSV structures. Because of its well-known application
for copper damascene, it was believed that its transfer to filling TSV vias
would be easily adopted. However, as any new technology at its beginning, there
are several challenges that need to be addressed and resolved before becoming a
fully mature technology. This paper will address the TSV fill processes using
copper electrodeposition, the advantages as well as difficulties associated
with this technology and approaches taken to overcome them. Electrochemical
characterization of the organics behavior and their effect on via filling will
be presented. The effect of wafer design on process performance and throughput,
including necessary process optimizations that are required for achieving
void-free via filling while reducing the processing time, will be discussed.

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2008, Nice : France (2008)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  3D-Integration is a promising technology towards higher interconnect
densities and shorter wiring lengths between multiple chip stacks, thus
achieving a very high performance level combined with low power consumption.
This technology also offers the possibility to build up systems with high
complexity just by combining devices of different technologies. For ultra thin
silicon is the base of this integration technology, the fundamental processing
steps will be described, as well as appropriate handling concepts. Three main
concepts for 3D integration have been developed at IZM. The approach with the
greatest flexibility called Inter Chip Via - Solid Liquid Interdiffusion
(ICV-SLID) is introduced. This is a chip-to-wafer stacking technology which
combines the advantages of the Inter Chip Via (ICV) process and the
solid-liquid-interdiffusion technique (SLID) of copper and tin. The fully
modular ICV-SLID concept allows the formation of multiple device stacks. A test
chip was designed and the total process sequence of the ICV-SLID technology for
the realization of a three-layer chip-to-wafer stack was demonstrated. The
proposed wafer-level 3D integration concept has the potential for low cost
fabrication of multi-layer high-performance 3D-SoCs and is well suited as a
replacement for embedded technologies based on monolithic integration. To
address yield issues a wafer-level chip-scale handling is presented as well, to
select known-good dies and work on them with wafer-level process sequences
before joining them to integrated stacks.

DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etching) to etch through-silicon via (TSV) for advanced
interconnections. The interconnection step can be done prior to or post CMOS
manufacturing, each requiring different etch process performances. A review of
the DRIE capability in terms of etching profile, etch rate, etch depth has been
carried out. Excellent tool flexibility allows a wide range of basic and
complex profiles to be achieved. Unlike other techniques, DRIE has the
capability to etch feature sizes ranging from sub-micron to millimeter width.
The main specificity of the DRIE is that etch rate is sensitive to the total
exposed area and the aspect ratio. For the TSV applications, where the total
exposed area is lower than 10%, high etch rates are achievable. A study has
also been done to highlight the importance of via profile for the success of
the refilling step. In addition, due to the high flexibility of DRIE, we also
explore the capability of using this technique for wafer thinning and plasma
die separation.

micrometers pitch for through wafer connections in up to 600 micrometers thick
substrates. Integrated with MEMS designs it enables significantly reduced die
size and true &quot;Wafer Level Packaging&quot; - features that are particularly
important in consumer market applications. The TSV technology also enables
integration of advanced interconnect functions in optical MEMS, sensors and
microfluidic devices. In addition the Via technology opens for very interesting
possibilities considering integration with CMOS processing. With several
companies using the process already today, qualified volume manufacturing in
place and a line-up of potential users, the process is becoming a standard in
the MEMS industry. We provide a introduction to the via formation process and
also present some on the novel solutions made available by the technology.

transduction principle. It is demonstrated that when the sensor topology
doesn't allow a perfect matching of strain gauges, the resolution is limited by
the ability of the conditioning circuit (typically a Wheatstone bridge) to
reject power supply noise. As this ability is strongly reduced when an offset
voltage is present at the output of the bridge, the proposed architecture
implements a feedback loop to control MOS transistors inserted in the
Wheatstone bridge to compensate resistor mismatches. This feedback exhibits a
very good offset cancellation and therefore a better resolution is achieved.

(Braunschweigs Integrated CAD-Environment for Product Planning and Process

obstacles. The database and process planning tool can be used by process
developers to document changes in process settings and the influence of such
changes on the process result. This information can then be used by the
designers to set-up a simulation file for a detailed analysis of the impact of
such parameter changes on the requested design. This will be shown by the
example of silicon etching using an atomistic etch simulator.

procedure for resonant MEMS structures. A design for high sensitivity of MEMS
structures needs to take into account the noise shaping induced by damping
phenomena at micro scale. The existing literature presents detailed models for
the damping at microscale, but usually neglects them in the noise analysis
process, assuming instead a white spectrum approximation for the
mechano-thermal noise. The present work extends the implications of the complex
gas-solid interaction into the field of noise analysis for mechanical sensors,
and provides a semi-automatic procedure for behavioral macromodel extraction
and sensor optimization with respect to signal-to-noise ratio.

sensing technologies for real-time simulation of microstructures. Cosserat
theory is chosen instead of the classical theory of elasticity for a better
representation of stress, especially in the nonlinear regime. The use of
Cosserat theory leads to a reduction of the complexity of the modelling and
thus increases its capability for real time simulation which is indispensable
for haptic technologies. The incorporation of Cosserat theory into haptic
sensing technology enables the designer to simulate in real-time the components
in a virtual reality environment (VRE) which can enable virtual manufacturing
and prototyping. The software tool created as a result of this methodology
demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed model. As test demonstrators, a
cantilever microbeam and microbridge undergoing bending in VRE are presented.

(SAW) resonators to temperature, a method of achieving device stability as a
function of temperature is required. This work presents the design, modeling
and characterization of integrated dual-serpentine polysilicon resistors as a
method for temperature control of CMOS SAW resonators. The design employs the
oven control temperature stabilization scheme where the device's temperature is
elevated to higher than Tmax to maintain constant device temperature. The
efficiency of the polysilicon resistor as a heating element was verified
through a 1-D partial differential equation model, 3-D CoventorWare finite
element simulations and measurements using Compix thermal camera. To verify
that the on-chip hotplate is effective as a temperature control method, both DC
and RF measurements of the heater together with the resonator were conducted.
Experimental results have indicated that the TCF of the CMOS SAW resonator of
-97.2 ppm/deg C has been reduced to -23.19 ppm/deg C when heated to 56 deg C.

analysis of complex geometrical structures and the assessment of various
interactions among different energy domains and components. Moreover, the MEMS
market is growing very fast, but surprisingly, there is a paucity of modelling
and simulation methodology for precise performance verification of MEMS
products in the nonlinear regime. For that reason, an efficient and rapid
modelling approach is proposed that meets the linear and nonlinear dynamic
behaviour of MEMS systems.

actuated single crystal silicon cantilever was proposed in this paper for
resonant based ultra-sensitive mass detection. Energy dissipation from
intrinsic mechanical loss of the PZT film was successfully compressed by
separating the PZT actuator from resonant structure. Excellent Q-factor, which
is several times larger than conventional PZT cantilever, was achieved under
both atmospheric pressure and reduced pressures. For a 30 micrometer-wide 100
micrometer-long cantilever, Q-factor was measured as high as 1113 and 7279
under the pressure of 101.2 KPa and 35 Pa, respectively. Moreover, it was found
that high-mode vibration can be realized by the cantilever for the pursuit of
great Q-factor, while support loss became significant because of the increased
vibration amplitude at the actuation point. An optimized structure using
node-point actuation was suggested then to suppress corresponding energy
dissipation.

produces hydrogen when Zn reacts with water. The system can be used as a
battery replacement for low power applications and has the potential to improve
the run time of autonomous systems. The efficiency has been investigated as
function of fuel cell construction and tested for several load profiles.

including power supply for portable electric devices. Utilize scavenging
ambient energy from the environment could eliminate the need for batteries and
increase portable device lifetimes indefinitely. In addition, through MEMS
technology fabricated micro-generator could easy integrate with these small or
portable devices. Several different ambient sources, including solar, vibration
and temperature effect, have already exploited [1-3]. Each energy source should
be used in suitable environment, therefore to produce maximum efficiency. In
this paper, we present an acoustic wave actuated micro-generator for power
system by using the energy of acoustic waves, such as the sound from human
voices or speakerphone, to actuate a MEMS-type electromagnetic transducer. This
provides a longer device lifetime and greater power system convenience.
Moreover, it is convenient to integrate MEMS-based microgenerators with small
or porta le devices

has become a crucial question in the semiconductor industry.

microelectronic and micro- electromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. In order
to determine their mechanical parameters, a new deformation bench test with

  MEMS/MOEMS - DTIP 2008, Nice : France (2008)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A novel open waveguide cavity resonator is presented for the combined
variable frequency microwave curing of bumps, underfills and encapsulants, as
well as the alignment of devices for fast flip-chip assembly, direct chip
attach (DCA) or wafer-scale level packaging (WSLP). This technology achieves
radio frequency (RF) curing of adhesives used in microelectronics,
optoelectronics and medical devices with potential simultaneous micron-scale
alignment accuracy and bonding of devices. In principle, the open oven cavity
can be fitted directly onto a flip-chip or wafer scale bonder and, as such,
will allow for the bonding of devices through localised heating thus reducing
the risk to thermally sensitive devices. Variable frequency microwave (VFM)
heating and curing of an idealised polymer load is numerically simulated using
a multi-physics approach. Electro-magnetic fields within a novel open ended
microwave oven developed for use in micro-electronics manufacturing
applications are solved using a de icated Yee scheme finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) solver. Temperature distribution, degree of cure and thermal
stresses are analysed using an Unstructured Finite Volume method (UFVM)
multi-physics package. The polymer load was meshed for thermophysical analysis,
whilst the microwave cavity - encompassing the polymer load - was meshed for
microwave irradiation. The two solution domains are linked using a
cross-mapping routine. The principle of heating using the evanescent fringing
fields within the open-end of the cavity is demonstrated. A closed loop
feedback routine is established allowing the temperature within a lossy sample
to be controlled. A distribution of the temperature within the lossy sample is
obtained by using a thermal imaging camera.

and is independent of the size of the ground set. In contrast, we show that
finding an optimal (0-best) solution requires exponential time even in a very
special case of the problem.

to switch dynamically between multiple wireless access-points (possibly
belonging to different standards) by introducing an iterated non-cooperative
game. Users start out completely uneducated and naive but, by using a fixed set
of strategies to process a broadcasted training signal, they quickly evolve and
converge to an evolutionarily stable equilibrium. Then, in order to measure
efficiency in this steady state, we adapt the notion of the price of anarchy to
our setting and we obtain an explicit analytic estimate for it by using methods
from statistical physics (namely the theory of replicas). Surprisingly, we find
that the price of anarchy does not depend on the specifics of the wireless
nodes (e.g. spectral efficiency) but only on the number of strategies per user
and a particular combination of the number of nodes, the number of users and
the size of the training signal. Finally, we map this game to the well-studied
minority game, generalizing its analysis to an arbitrary number of choices.

larger than the minimum of the number of transmit and receive dimensions. This
suggests that for the scalar broadcast channel, the pre-log cannot exceed one.
By contrast, in this note, we show that when the noises are anti-correlated and
feedback is present, then a pre-log of two can be attained. In other words, in
this special case, in the limit of high SNR, the scalar Gaussian broadcast
channel turns into two parallel AWGN channels. Achievability is established via
a coding strategy due to Schalkwijk, Kailath, and Ozarow.

decomposition techniques are hard to apply to problems with complete initial
constraint graphs. For such problems, we propose a hybrid approach of these
techniques in the presence of global constraints. In particular, we solve the
subgraph isomorphism problem. Further we design specific heuristics for this
hard problem, exploiting its special structure to achieve decomposition. The
underlying idea is to precompute a static heuristic on a subset of its
constraint network, to follow this static ordering until a first problem
decomposition is available, and to switch afterwards to a fully propagated,
dynamically decomposing search. Experimental results show that, for sparse
graphs, our decomposition method solves more instances than dedicated,
state-of-the-art matching algorithms or standard constraint programming
approaches.

obtained by replacing simpler objective functions with general submodular
functions. The new problems include submodular load balancing, which
generalizes load balancing or minimum-makespan scheduling, submodular sparsest
cut and submodular balanced cut, which generalize their respective graph cut
problems, as well as submodular function minimization with a cardinality lower
bound. We establish upper and lower bounds for the approximability of these
problems with a polynomial number of queries to a function-value oracle. The
approximation guarantees for most of our algorithms are of the order of
sqrt(n/ln n). We show that this is the inherent difficulty of the problems by
proving matching lower bounds. We also give an improved lower bound for the
problem of approximately learning a monotone submodular function. In addition,
we present an algorithm for approximately learning submodular functions with
special structure, whose guarantee is close to the lower bound. Although quite
restrictive, the class of functions with this structure includes the ones that
are used for lower bounds both by us and in previous work. This demonstrates
that if there are significantly stronger lower bounds for this problem, they
rely on more general submodular functions.

throughput in a multicast switch using network coding. By bounding speedup, we
show the equivalence between network coding and speedup in multicast switches -
i.e. network coding, which is usually implemented using software, can in many
cases substitute speedup, which is often achieved by adding extra switch
fabrics. This bound is based on an approach to network coding problems called
the &quot;enhanced conflict graph&quot;. We show that the &quot;imperfection ratio&quot; of the
enhanced conflict graph gives an upper bound on speedup. In particular, we
apply this result to K-by-N switches with traffic patterns consisting of
unicasts and broadcasts only to obtain an upper bound of min{(2K-1)/K,
2N/(N+1)}.

what value of parameter 'preference' can yield an optimal clustering solution,
and oscillations cannot be eliminated automatically if occur. The adaptive AP
method is proposed to overcome these limitations, including adaptive scanning
of preferences to search space of the number of clusters for finding the
optimal clustering solution, adaptive adjustment of damping factors to
eliminate oscillations, and adaptive escaping from oscillations when the
damping adjustment technique fails. Experimental results on simulated and real
data sets show that the adaptive AP is effective and can outperform AP in
quality of clustering results.

  Congestion Games</title><categories>cs.GT</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We study the convergence time of the best response dynamics in
player-specific singleton congestion games. It is well known that this dynamics
can cycle, although from every state a short sequence of best responses to a
Nash equilibrium exists. Thus, the random best response dynamics, which selects
the next player to play a best response uniformly at random, terminates in a
Nash equilibrium with probability one. In this paper, we are interested in the
expected number of best responses until the random best response dynamics
terminates.
  As a first step towards this goal, we consider games in which each player can
choose between only two resources. These games have a natural representation as
(multi-)graphs by identifying nodes with resources and edges with players. For
the class of games that can be represented as trees, we show that the
best-response dynamics cannot cycle and that it terminates after O(n^2) steps
where n denotes the number of resources. For the class of games represented as
cycles, we show that the best response dynamics can cycle. However, we also
show that the random best response dynamics terminates after O(n^2) steps in
expectation.
  Additionally, we conjecture that in general player-specific singleton
congestion games there exists no polynomial upper bound on the expected number
of steps until the random best response dynamics terminates. We support our
conjecture by presenting a family of games for which simulations indicate a
super-polynomial convergence time.

  vs. a Primary Network</title><categories>cs.IT cs.NI math.IT</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We study the scaling laws for the throughputs and delays of two coexisting
wireless networks that operate in the same geographic region. The primary
network consists of Poisson distributed legacy users of density n, and the
secondary network consists of Poisson distributed cognitive users of density m,
with m&gt;n. The primary users have a higher priority to access the spectrum
without particular considerations for the secondary users, while the secondary
users have to act conservatively in order to limit the interference to the
primary users. With a practical assumption that the secondary users only know
the locations of the primary transmitters (not the primary receivers), we first
show that both networks can achieve the same throughput scaling law as what
Gupta and Kumar [1] established for a stand-alone wireless network if proper
transmission schemes are deployed, where a certain throughput is achievable for
each individual secondary user (i.e., zero outage) with high probability. By
using a fluid model, we also show that both networks can achieve the same
delay-throughput tradeoff as the optimal one established by El Gamal et al. [2]
for a stand-alone wireless network.

media and seek simple, online mechanisms to reserve ad slots in advance. Media
publishers represent a vast and varying inventory, and they too seek automatic,
online mechanisms for pricing and allocating such reservations. In this paper,
we present and study a simple model for auctioning such ad slots in advance.
Bidders arrive sequentially and report which slots they are interested in. The
seller must decide immediately whether or not to grant a reservation. Our model
allows a seller to accept reservations, but possibly cancel the allocations
later and pay the bidder a cancellation compensation (bump payment). Our main
result is an online mechanism to derive prices and bump payments that is
efficient to implement. This mechanism has many desirable properties. It is
individually rational; winners have an incentive to be honest and bidding one's
true value dominates any lower bid. Our mechanism's efficiency is within a
constant fraction of the a posteriori optimally efficient solution. Its revenue
is within a constant fraction of the a posteriori revenue of the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. Our results make no assumptions about the
order of arrival of bids or the value distribution of bidders and still hold if
the items for sale are elements of a matroid, a more general setting than slot
allocation.

  Communications</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Two-tier networks, comprising a conventional cellular network overlaid with
shorter range hotspots (e.g. femtocells, distributed antennas, or wired
relays), offer an economically viable way to improve cellular system capacity.
The capacity-limiting factor in such networks is interference. The cross-tier
interference between macrocells and femtocells can suffocate the capacity due
to the near-far problem, so in practice hotspots should use a different
frequency channel than the potentially nearby high-power macrocell users.
Centralized or coordinated frequency planning, which is difficult and
inefficient even in conventional cellular networks, is all but impossible in a
two-tier network. This paper proposes and analyzes an optimum decentralized
spectrum allocation policy for two-tier networks that employ frequency division
multiple access (including OFDMA). The proposed allocation is optimal in terms
of Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE), and is subjected to a sensible Quality of
Service (QoS) requirement, which guarantees that both macrocell and femtocell
users attain at least a prescribed data rate. Results show the dependence of
this allocation on the QoS requirement, hotspot density and the co-channel
interference from the macrocell and surrounding femtocells. Design
interpretations of this result are provided.

during the entire course of the computation furthermore tasks can have

competitive ratio is dependent on the dynamics of the communication medium and
also on the nature of the dependencies among the tasks.

Nevertheless, greedy packets find their destinations with 100% probability
following almost optimal shortest paths. This remarkable efficiency sustains
even in highly dynamic networks. Our findings suggest that forwarding
information through complex networks, such as the Internet, is possible without
the overhead of existing routing protocols, and may also find practical
applications in overlay networks for tasks such as application-level routing,
information sharing, and data distribution.

mines is derived directly longwall mining method. Out of seam dilution is one
of the essential problems in these mines. Therefore the dilution can impose the
additional cost of mining and milling. As a result, recognition of the
effective parameters on the dilution has a remarkable role in industry. In this
way, this paper has analyzed the influence of 13 parameters (attributed
variables) versus the decision attribute (dilution value), so that using two
approximate reasoning methods, namely Rough Set Theory (RST) and Self
Organizing Neuro- Fuzzy Inference System (SONFIS) the best rules on our
collected data sets has been extracted. The other benefit of later methods is
to predict new unknown cases. So, the reduced sets (reducts) by RST have been
obtained. Therefore the emerged results by utilizing mentioned methods shows
that the high sensitive variables are thickness of layer, length of stope, rate
of advance, number of miners, type of advancing.

regular structure and its close resemblance with FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate
Arrays). AND-EXOR based circuits are of interest in the design of very low
power circuits where energy loss implied by high frequency switching is of much
consideration. This paper examines the testability of AND-EXOR based Iterative
Logic Arrays (ILAs). For certain ILAs it is possible to find a test set whose
size remains constant irrespective of the size of the ILA, while for others it
varies with array size. Former type of ILAs is known as Constant-Testable
(C-Testable). It has been shown that AND-EXOR based Logic Arrays are C-Testable
and size of test set is equal to number of entries in cell truth table. The
test generation problem has been shown to be related to certain properties of
cycles in a set of graphs derived from cell truth table. By careful analysis of
these cycles an efficient test generation technique that can be easily
converted to an ATPG program has been presented for both 1D and 2D ILAs. How
this property of ILAs can be used for testing FPGAs has also been discussed.

incremental analysis of data leads to results on demand. Here, we describe a
framework that uses symbolic cells to calculate associations based on
transactional data streams as it exists in e.g. bibliographic databases. We
follow a natural paradigm of applying simple operations on cells yielding on a
mind-map structure that adapts over time.

wireless random access network based on a Markov renewal model of packet
transportation. We show that the distribution of the source-to-destination (SD)
distance plays a critical role in characterizing network performance. We
establish necessary and sufficient condition on the SD distance for scalable
network throughput, and address the optimal rate allocation issue with fairness
and the QoS requirements taken into consideration. In respect to the end-to-end
performance, the transport delay is explored in this paper along with network
throughput. We characterize the transport delay by relating it to nodal
queueing behavior and the SD-distance distribution; the former is a local
property while the latter is a global property. In addition, we apply the large
deviation theory to derive the tail distribution of transport delay. To put our
theory into practical network operation, several traffic scaling laws are
provided to demonstrate how network scalability can be achieved by localizing
the traffic pattern, and a leaky bucket scheme at the network access is
proposed for traffic shaping and flow control.

dynamical stabilization of dissipative rotating spiral waves (RSWs) in the
cellular-automaton model of laser-like excitable media proposed in
arXiv:cond-mat/0410460v2 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0602345 . Part of the observed
features are caused by unusual mechanism of excitation vorticity when the RSW's
core get into the surface layer of an active medium. Instead of the well known
scenario of RSW collapse, which takes place after collision of RSW's core with
absorbing boundary, we observed complicated transformations of the core leading
to regeneration (nonlinear &quot;reflection&quot; from the boundary) of the RSW or even
to birth of several new RSWs in the surface layer. Computer experiments on
bottlenecked evolution of such the RSW-ensembles (vortex matter) are reported
and a possible explanation of real experiments on spin-lattice relaxation in
dilute paramagnets is proposed on the basis of an analysis of the RSWs
dynamics. Chimera states in RSW-ensembles are revealed and compared with
analogous states in ensembles of nonlocally coupled oscillators. Generally, our
computer experiments have shown that vortex matter states in laser-like
excitable media have some important features of aggregate states of the usual
matter.

  Perspective</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. Conference
  version in 2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, Toronto,
  Canada, July 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We revisit the information-theoretic analysis of bit-interleaved coded
modulation (BICM) by modeling the BICM decoder as a mismatched decoder. The
mismatched decoding model is well-defined for finite, yet arbitrary, block
lengths, and naturally captures the channel memory among the bits belonging to
the same symbol. We give two independent proofs of the achievability of the
BICM capacity calculated by Caire et al. where BICM was modeled as a set of
independent parallel binary-input channels whose output is the bitwise
log-likelihood ratio. Our first achievability proof uses typical sequences, and
shows that due to the random coding construction, the interleaver is not
required. The second proof is based on the random coding error exponents with
mismatched decoding, where the largest achievable rate is the generalized
mutual information. We show that the generalized mutual information of the
mismatched decoder coincides with the infinite-interleaver BICM capacity. We
also show that the error exponent -and hence the cutoff rate- of the BICM
mismatched decoder is upper bounded by that of coded modulation and may thus be
lower than in the infinite-interleaved model. We also consider the mutual
information appearing in the analysis of iterative decoding of BICM with EXIT
charts. We show that the corresponding symbol metric has knowledge of the
transmitted symbol and the EXIT mutual information admits a representation as a
pseudo-generalized mutual information, which is in general not achievable. A
different symbol decoding metric, for which the extrinsic side information
refers to the hypothesized symbol, induces a generalized mutual information
lower than the coded modulation capacity.

constraints. Two distinct network models, namely the interference channel with
confidential messages and the one with an external eavesdropper, are analyzed.
Using interference alignment along with secrecy pre-coding at each transmitter,
it is shown that each user in the network can achieve non-zero secure Degrees
of Freedoms (DoFs) in both scenarios. In particular, the proposed coding scheme
achieves (K-2)/(2K-2) secure DoFs for each user in the interference channel
with confidential messages model, and (K-2)/2K secure DoFs in the case of an
external eavesdropper. The fundamental difference between the two scenarios
stems from the lack of channel state information (CSI) about the external
eavesdropper. Remarkably, the results establish the positive impact of
interference on the secrecy capacity of wireless networks.

  version of Razborov--Rudich; new proof of main result by Salil Vadhan added</comments><acm-class>F.1.3</acm-class><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Razborov and Rudich have shown that so-called &quot;natural proofs&quot; are not useful
for separating P from NP unless hard pseudorandom number generators do not
exist. This famous result is widely regarded as a serious barrier to proving
strong lower bounds in circuit complexity theory.
  By definition, a natural combinatorial property satisfies two conditions,
constructivity and largeness. Our main result is that if the largeness
condition is weakened slightly, then not only does the Razborov-Rudich proof
break down, but such &quot;almost-natural&quot; (and useful) properties provably exist.
Specifically, under the same pseudorandomness assumption that Razborov and
Rudich make, a simple, explicit property that we call &quot;discrimination&quot; suffices
to separate P/poly from NP; discrimination is nearly linear-time computable and
almost large, having density 2^{-q(n)} where q is a quasi-polynomial function.
For those who hope to separate P from NP using random function properties in
some sense, discrimination is interesting, because it is constructive, yet may
be thought of as a minor alteration of a property of a random function.
  The proof relies heavily on the self-defeating character of natural proofs.
Our proof technique also yields an unconditional result, namely that there
exist almost-large and useful properties that are constructive, if we are
allowed to call non-uniform low-complexity classes &quot;constructive.&quot; We note,
though, that this unconditional result can also be proved by a more
conventional counting argument.
  Finally, we give an alternative proof, communicated to us by Salil Vadhan at
FOCS 2008, of one of our theorems, and we make some speculative remarks on the
future prospects for proving strong circuit lower bounds.

quadratic time algorithm. We present a linear time algorithm for solving
weak-parity games.

described. In general, these matrices include a finite number of non-zero

simple cellular uplink channel, and a time varying inter-symbol interference
channel. Selected recent information-theoretic works dealing directly with such
channels are reviewed. Finally, several characteristics of the still unknown
limiting spectrum of such matrices are listed, and some reflections are touched
upon.

  Wireless Communication Networks</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This paper considers broadcast channels with L antennas at the base station
and m single-antenna users, where L and m are typically of the same order. We
assume that only partial channel state information is available at the base
station through a finite rate feedback. Our key observation is that the optimal
number of on-users (users turned on), say s, is a function of signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and feedback rate. In support of this, an asymptotic analysis is
employed where L, m and the feedback rate approach infinity linearly. We derive
the asymptotic optimal feedback strategy as well as a realistic criterion to
decide which users should be turned on. The corresponding asymptotic throughput
per antenna, which we define as the spatial efficiency, turns out to be a
function of the number of on-users s, and therefore s must be chosen
appropriately. Based on the asymptotics, a scheme is developed for systems with
finite many antennas and users. Compared with other studies in which s is
presumed constant, our scheme achieves a significant gain. Furthermore, our
analysis and scheme are valid for heterogeneous systems where different users
may have different path loss coefficients and feedback rates.

on extensions of classical temporal logics with cost constraints on modalities.
We prove that, under the assumption that the model has only one clock,
model-checking this class of models against the logic WCTL, CTL with
cost-constrained modalities, is PSPACE-complete (while it has been shown
undecidable as soon as the model has three clocks). We also prove that
model-checking WMTL, LTL with cost-constrained modalities, is decidable only if
there is a single clock in the model and a single stopwatch cost variable
(i.e., whose slopes lie in {0,1}).

congruence on propositions modulo which the inference rules of standard
deductive systems---such as for instance natural deduction---are applied.
Therefore, the reasoning that is intrinsic of the theory does not appear in the
length of proofs. In general, the congruence is defined through a rewrite
system over terms and propositions. We define a rigorous framework to study
proof lengths in deduction modulo, where the congruence must be computed in
polynomial time. We show that even very simple rewrite systems lead to
arbitrary proof-length speed-ups in deduction modulo, compared to using axioms.
As higher-order logic can be encoded as a first-order theory in deduction
modulo, we also study how to reinterpret, thanks to deduction modulo, the
speed-ups between higher-order and first-order arithmetics that were stated by
G\&quot;odel. We define a first-order rewrite system with a congruence decidable in
polynomial time such that proofs of higher-order arithmetic can be linearly
translated into first-order arithmetic modulo that system. We also present the
whole higher-order arithmetic as a first-order system without resorting to any
axiom, where proofs have the same length as in the axiomatic presentation.

statistical mechanics. In our model a student of a simple perceptron learns
from not a true teacher directly, but ensemble teachers who learn from the true
teacher with a perceptron learning rule. Since the true teacher and the
ensemble teachers are expressed as non-monotonic perceptron and simple ones,
respectively, the ensemble teachers go around the unlearnable true teacher with
the distance between them fixed in an asymptotic steady state. The
generalization performance of the student is shown to exceed that of the
ensemble teachers in a transient state, as was shown in similar
ensemble-teachers models. Further, it is found that moving the ensemble
teachers even in the steady state, in contrast to the fixed ensemble teachers,
is efficient for the performance of the student.

via a distributed MIMO transceiver is considered. The source operates each of
the transmit antennas via finite-capacity links, and likewise the destination
is connected to the receiving antennas through capacity-constrained channels.
Targeting a nomadic communication scenario, in which the distributed MIMO
transceiver is designed to serve different standards or services, transmitters
and receivers are assumed to be oblivious to the encoding functions shared by
source and destination. Adopting a Gaussian symmetric interference network as
the channel model (as for regularly placed transmitters and receivers),
achievable rates are investigated and compared with an upper bound. It is
concluded that in certain asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes obliviousness
of transmitters and receivers does not cause any loss of optimality.

predicates, i.e. spatial predicates associated with an exact temporal
constraint. A set of such predicates forms a buffer query or a Spatio-temporal
Pattern (STP) Query with time. In the more general case of an STP query, the
temporal dimension is introduced via the relative order of the spatial
predicates (STP queries with order). Therefore, the efficient processing of a
spatiotemporal predicate is crucial for the efficient implementation of more
complex queries of practical interest. We propose an extension of a known
approach, suitable for processing spatial predicates, which has been used for
the efficient manipulation of STP queries with order. The extended method is
supported by efficient indexing structures. We also provide experimental
results that show the efficiency of the technique.

groups of already related nodes arrive together and attach to an existing
network, we consider network growth via sequential attachment of linked node
groups, or graphlets. We analyze the simplest case, attachment of the three
node V-graphlet, where, with probability alpha, we attach a peripheral node of
the graphlet, and with probability (1-alpha), we attach the central node. Our
analytical results and simulations show that tuning alpha produces a wide range
in degree distribution and degree assortativity, achieving assortativity values
that capture a diverse set of many real-world systems. We introduce a
fifteen-dimensional attribute vector derived from seven well-known network
properties, which enables comprehensive comparison between any two networks.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of this attribute vector space shows a
significantly larger coverage potential of real-world network properties by a
simple extension of the above model when compared against a classic model of
network growth.

between two sets of n sources and n sinks in complex networks. We derive
analytical formulas for the average current and flow as a function of n. We
show that for small n, increasing n improves the total transport in the
network, while for large n bottlenecks begin to form. For the case of flow,
this leads to an optimal n* above which the transport is less efficient. For
current, the typical decrease in the length of the connecting paths for large n
compensates for the effect of the bottlenecks. We also derive an expression for
the average flow as a function of n under the common limitation that transport
takes place between specific pairs of sources and sinks.

relevance to ecological conservation management. It asks to maximize the
phylogenetic diversity (PD) of a set of taxa given a fixed budget, where each
taxon is associated with a cost of conservation and a probability of
extinction. NAP has received renewed interest with the rise in availability of
genetic sequence data, allowing PD to be used as a practical measure of
biodiversity. However, only simplified instances of the problem, where one or
more parameters are fixed as constants, have as of yet been addressed in the
literature. We present NAPX, the first algorithm for the general version of NAP
that returns a $1 - \epsilon$ approximation of the optimal solution. It runs in
$O(\frac{n B^2 h^2 \log^2n}{\log^2(1 - \epsilon)})$ time where $n$ is the
number of species, and $B$ is the total budget and $h$ is the height of the
input tree. We also provide improved bounds for its expected running time.

  Tanner Graph Covers</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We discuss error floor asympotics and present a method for improving the
performance of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes in the high SNR (error
floor) region.
  The method is based on Tanner graph covers that do not have trapping sets
from the original code. The advantages of the method are that it is universal,
as it can be applied to any LDPC code/channel/decoding algorithm and it
improves performance at the expense of increasing the code length, without
losing the code regularity, without changing the decoding algorithm, and, under
certain conditions, without lowering the code rate. The proposed method can be
modified to construct convolutional LDPC codes also.
  The method is illustrated by modifying Tanner, MacKay and Margulis codes to
improve performance on the binary symmetric channel (BSC) under the Gallager B
decoding algorithm. Decoding results on AWGN channel are also presented to
illustrate that optimizing codes for one channel/decoding algorithm can lead to
performance improvement on other channels.

  ANNIE'04</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In a previous work, the authors proposed a Grammatical Evolution algorithm to
automatically generate Lindenmayer Systems which represent fractal curves with
a pre-determined fractal dimension. This paper gives strong statistical
evidence that the probability distributions of the execution time of that
algorithm exhibits a heavy tail with an hyperbolic probability decay for long
executions, which explains the erratic performance of different executions of
the algorithm. Three different restart strategies have been incorporated in the
algorithm to mitigate the problems associated to heavy tail distributions: the
first assumes full knowledge of the execution time probability distribution,
the second and third assume no knowledge. These strategies exploit the fact
that the probability of finding a solution in short executions is
non-negligible and yield a severe reduction, both in the expected execution
time (up to one order of magnitude) and in its variance, which is reduced from
an infinite to a finite value.

Deg(S) = 4/3 Deg(R), where Supply S is an isotropic radiative energy source,
Receipt R receives S's energy, and Deg is a system's degrees of freedom based
on its mean path length. S's 1/3 more degrees of freedom relative to R enables
R's growth and increasing complexity. Second, rho(R) = Deg(R) times rho(r),
where rho(R) represents the collective rate of R and rho(r) represents the rate
of an individual in R: as Deg(R) increases due to the first principle, the
multiplier effect of networking in R increases. A universe like ours with
isotropic energy distribution, in which both principles are operative, is
therefore predisposed to exhibit emergence, and, for reasons shown, a
ubiquitous role for the natural logarithm.

annular structure. Design/Methodology/Approach: A swarm-based model that
requires only stochastic agent behaviour coupled with a pheromone-inspired
&quot;attraction-repulsion&quot; mechanism. Findings: The algorithm consistently
generates high-quality annular structures, and is particularly powerful in
situations where the initial configuration of objects is similar to those
observed in nature. Research limitations/implications: Experimental evidence
supports previous theoretical arguments about the nature and mechanism of
spatial sorting by insects. Practical implications: The algorithm may find
applications in distributed robotics. Originality/value: The model offers a
powerful minimal algorithmic framework, and also sheds further light on the
nature of attraction-repulsion algorithms and underlying natural processes.

spreadsheet programs. The strategies presented are grounded on the assumption
that spreadsheets are software, albeit of a different nature than conventional
procedural software. Correspondingly, strategies for identifying errors have to
take into account the inherent properties of spreadsheets as much as they have
to recognize that the conceptual models of 'spreadsheet programmers' differ
from the conceptual models of conventional programmers. Nevertheless, nobody
can and will write a spreadsheet, without having such a conceptual model in
mind, be it of numeric nature or be it of geometrical nature focused on some
layout.

one-time use there is a rather neglected proportion of spreadsheets that are
huge, periodically used, and submitted to regular update-cycles like any
conventionally evolving valuable legacy application software. However, due to
the very nature of spreadsheets, their evolution is particularly tricky and
therefore error-prone. In our strive to develop tools and methodologies to
improve spreadsheet quality, we analysed consolidation spreadsheets of an
internationally operating company for the errors they contain. The paper
presents the results of the field audit, involving 78 spreadsheets with 60,446
non-empty cells. As a by-product, the study performed was also to validate our
analysis tools in an industrial context. The evaluated auditing tool offers the
auditor a new view on the formula structure of the spreadsheet by grouping
similar formulas into equivalence classes. Our auditing approach defines three
similarity criteria between formulae, namely copy, logical and structural
equivalence. To improve the visualization of large spreadsheets, equivalences
and data dependencies are displayed in separated windows that are interlinked
with the spreadsheet. The auditing approach helps to find irregularities in the
geometrical pattern of similar formulas.

the search results in response to user queries. Such sponsored search relies on
market mechanisms to elicit prices for these advertisements, making use of an
auction among advertisers who bid in order to have their ads shown for specific
keywords. We present an overview of the current systems for such auctions and
also describe the underlying game-theoretic aspects. The game involves three
parties--advertisers, the search engine, and search users--and we present
example research directions that emphasize the role of each. The algorithms for
bidding and pricing in these games use techniques from three mathematical
areas: mechanism design, optimization, and statistical estimation. Finally, we
present some challenges in sponsored search advertising.

for testing whether an unknown function $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ is an
$s$-sparse GF(2) polynomial versus $\eps$-far from every such polynomial. Our
algorithm makes $\poly(s,1/\eps)$ black-box queries to $f$ and runs in time $n
\cdot \poly(s,1/\eps)$. The only previous algorithm for this testing problem
\cite{DLM+:07} used poly$(s,1/\eps)$ queries, but had running time exponential
in $s$ and super-polynomial in $1/\eps$.
  Our approach significantly extends the ``testing by implicit learning''
methodology of \cite{DLM+:07}. The learning component of that earlier work was
a brute-force exhaustive search over a concept class to find a hypothesis
consistent with a sample of random examples. In this work, the learning
component is a sophisticated exact learning algorithm for sparse GF(2)
polynomials due to Schapire and Sellie \cite{SchapireSellie:96}. A crucial
element of this work, which enables us to simulate the membership queries
required by \cite{SchapireSellie:96}, is an analysis establishing new
properties of how sparse GF(2) polynomials simplify under certain restrictions
of ``low-influence'' sets of variables.

systems, or multi-agent systems are widely used in Computer Science, e.g. for
network security, optimisations, or simulations. In these systems, small
entities move through the network and perform certain tasks. At some time, the
entities move to another place and require therefore information where to move
is most profitable. Common used systems do not provide any information or use a
centralised approach where a center delegates the entities. This article
discusses whether small information about the neighbours enhances the
performance of the overall system or not. Therefore, two information-protocols
are introduced and analysed. In addition, the protocols are implemented and
tested using the artificial immune system SANA that protects a network against
intrusions.

like e.g. biological viruses and bacteria. Artificial immune systems reuse the
architecture, organization, and workflows of the human immune system for
various problems in computer science. In the network security, the artificial
immune system is used to secure a network and its nodes against intrusions like
viruses, worms, and trojans. However, these approaches are far away from
production where they are academic proof-of-concept implementations or use only
a small part to protect against a certain intrusion. This article discusses the
required steps to bring artificial immune systems into production in the
network security domain. It furthermore figures out the challenges and provides
the description and results of the prototype of an artificial immune system,
which is SANA called.

- e.g. classifiers or rule-based firewall systems to detect intrusions and
anomalies and to secure a network against viruses, worms, or trojans. However,
these network systems rely on individuality and support an architecture with
less collaborative work of the protection components. They give less
administration support for maintenance, but offer a large number of individual
single points of failures - an ideal situation for network attacks to succeed.
In this work, we discuss the required features, the performance, and the
problems of a distributed protection system called {\it SANA}. It consists of a
cooperative architecture, it is motivated by the human immune system, where the
components correspond to artificial immune cells that are connected for their
collaborative work. SANA promises a better protection against intruders than
common known protection systems through an adaptive self-management while
keeping the resources efficiently by an intelligent reduction of redundancies.
We introduce a library of several novel and common used protection components
and evaluate the performance of SANA by a proof-of-concept implementation.

the Social Force Model in the Vissim simulation framework. Concerning the
experiments it is argued that the basic dependence between flow and bottleneck
width is not a step function but that it is linear and modified by the effect
of a psychological phenomenon. The simulation results as well show a linear
dependence and the parameters can be calibrated such that the absolute values
for flow and time fit to range of experimental results.

non-equilibrium quantum spin systems that are continuously measured and
controlled. The notion of a spin system is broadly conceived, in order to
encompass macroscopic test masses as the limiting case of large-j spins. The
simulation technique has three stages: first the deliberate introduction of
noise into the simulation, then the conversion of that noise into an equivalent
continuous measurement and control process, and finally, projection of the
trajectory onto a state-space manifold having reduced dimensionality and
possessing a Kahler potential of multi-linear form. The resulting simulation
formalism is used to construct a positive P-representation for the thermal
density matrix. Single-spin detection by magnetic resonance force microscopy
(MRFM) is simulated, and the data statistics are shown to be those of a random
telegraph signal with additive white noise. Larger-scale spin-dust models are
simulated, having no spatial symmetry and no spatial ordering; the
high-fidelity projection of numerically computed quantum trajectories onto
low-dimensionality Kahler state-space manifolds is demonstrated. The
reconstruction of quantum trajectories from sparse random projections is
demonstrated, the onset of Donoho-Stodden breakdown at the Candes-Tao sparsity
limit is observed, a deterministic construction for sampling matrices is given,
and methods for quantum state optimization by Dantzig selection are given.

segmentation through an interactive model-based approach. Interaction is
expressed in the model creation, which is done according to user traces drawn
over a given input image. Both model and input are then represented by means of
attributed relational graphs derived on the fly. Appearance features are taken
into account as object attributes and structural properties are expressed as
relational attributes. To cope with possible topological differences between
both graphs, a new structure called the deformation graph is introduced. The
segmentation process corresponds to finding a labelling of the input graph that
minimizes the deformations introduced in the model when it is updated with
input information. This approach has shown to be faster than other segmentation
methods, with competitive output quality. Therefore, the method solves the
problem of multiple label segmentation in an efficient way. Encouraging results
on both natural and target-specific color images, as well as examples showing
the reusability of the model, are presented and discussed.

The
goal is to efficiently encode the observations in a distributed fashion so as
to enable reconstruction of any one of the observations, say the first one, at
the decoder subject to a quadratic fidelity criterion. Our main result is a
precise characterization of the rate-distortion region when the covariance
matrix of the sources satisfies a &quot;tree-structure&quot; condition. In this
situation, a natural analog-digital separation scheme optimally trades off the
distributed quantization rate tuples and the distortion in the reconstruction:
each encoder consists of a point-to-point Gaussian vector quantizer followed by
a Slepian-Wolf binning encoder. We also provide a partial converse that
suggests that the tree structure condition is fundamental.

popular in the field of ubiquitous computing, in particular for objects
identification. An RFID system is composed by one or more readers and a number
of tags. One of the main issues in an RFID network is the fast and reliable
identification of all tags in the reader range. The reader issues some queries,
and tags properly answer. Then, the reader must identify the tags from such
answers. This is crucial for most applications. Since the transmission medium
is shared, the typical problem to be faced is a MAC-like one, i.e. to avoid or
limit the number of tags transmission collisions. We propose a protocol which,
under some assumptions about transmission techniques, always achieves a 100%
perfomance. It is based on a proper recursive splitting of the concurrent tags
sets, until all tags have been identified. The other approaches present in
literature have performances of about 42% in the average at most. The
counterpart is a more sophisticated hardware to be deployed in the manufacture
of low cost tags.

(PS), foreground background processor sharing (FBPS) and shortest remaining
processing time first (SRPT) scheduling disciplines on an event where the job
size of a customer arriving in stationarity is smaller than exactly k&gt;=0 out of
the preceding m&gt;=k arrivals. Then, conditioning on the preceding event, the
sojourn time distribution of this newly arriving customer behaves
asymptotically the same as if the customer were served in isolation with a
server of rate (1-\rho)/(k+1) for PS/FBPS, and (1-\rho) for SRPT, respectively,
where \rho is the traffic intensity. Hence, the introduced notion of
conditional limits allows us to distinguish the asymptotic performance of the
studied schedulers by showing that SRPT exhibits considerably better asymptotic
behavior for relatively smaller jobs than PS/FBPS.
  Inspired by the preceding results, we propose an approximation to the SRPT
discipline based on a novel adaptive job grouping mechanism that uses relative
size comparison of a newly arriving job to the preceding m arrivals.
Specifically, if the newly arriving job is smaller than k and larger than m-k
of the previous m jobs, it is routed into class k. Then, the classes of smaller
jobs are served with higher priorities using the static priority scheduling.
The good performance of this mechanism, even for a small number of classes m+1,
is demonstrated using the asymptotic queueing analysis under the heavy-tailed
job requirements. We also discuss refinements of the comparison grouping
mechanism that improve the accuracy of job classification at the expense of a
small additional complexity.

RCP has no two announcement solution when the adversary has sufficiently large

applications devoted to monitoring critical areas where sensors can not be
deployed manually. In these networks, each sensor adapts its position on the
basis of a local evaluation of the coverage efficiency, thus permitting an
autonomous deployment.
  Several algorithms have been proposed to deploy mobile sensors over the area
of interest. The applicability of these approaches largely depends on a proper
formalization of rigorous rules to coordinate sensor movements, solve local
conflicts and manage possible failures of communications and devices.
  In this paper we introduce P&amp;P, a communication protocol that permits a
correct and efficient coordination of sensor movements in agreement with the
PUSH&amp;PULL algorithm. We deeply investigate and solve the problems that may
occur when coordinating asynchronous local decisions in the presence of an
unreliable transmission medium and possibly faulty devices such as in the
typical working scenario of mobile sensor networks.
  Simulation results show the performance of our protocol under a range of
operative settings, including conflict situations, irregularly shaped target
areas, and node failures.

focus on policy representation using classifiers and address policy learning as
a supervised learning problem, have been proposed recently. Finding good
policies with such methods requires not only an appropriate classifier, but
also reliable examples of best actions, covering the state space sufficiently.
Up to this time, little work has been done on appropriate covering schemes and
on methods for reducing the sample complexity of such methods, especially in
continuous state spaces. This paper focuses on the simplest possible covering
scheme (a discretized grid over the state space) and performs a
sample-complexity comparison between the simplest (and previously commonly
used) rollout sampling allocation strategy, which allocates samples equally at
each state under consideration, and an almost as simple method, which allocates
samples only as needed and requires significantly fewer samples.

approximate policy iteration schemes without value functions which focus on

iteration scheme which addresses the core sampling problem in evaluating a
policy through simulation as a multi-armed bandit machine. The resulting
algorithm offers comparable performance to the previous algorithm achieved,
however, with significantly less computational effort. An order of magnitude
improvement is demonstrated experimentally in two standard reinforcement
learning domains: inverted pendulum and mountain-car.

on the Web in a collaborative fashion. The increasing popularity of these
systems as well as first insights into their emergent semantics have made them
relevant to disciplines like knowledge extraction and ontology learning. The
problem of devising methods to measure the semantic relatedness between tags
and characterizing it semantically is still largely open. Here we analyze three
measures of tag relatedness: tag co-occurrence, cosine similarity of
co-occurrence distributions, and FolkRank, an adaptation of the PageRank
algorithm to folksonomies. Each measure is computed on tags from a large-scale
dataset crawled from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us. To provide a
semantic grounding of our findings, a connection to WordNet (a semantic lexicon
for the English language) is established by mapping tags into synonym sets of
WordNet, and applying there well-known metrics of semantic similarity. Our
results clearly expose different characteristics of the selected measures of
relatedness, making them applicable to different subtasks of knowledge
extraction such as synonym detection or discovery of concept hierarchies.

that differs from the standard construction used in Scott's denotational
semantics. In addition, we construct several other infinite CPO's. For some of
those, we apply the usual Fixed Point Theorem (FPT) to yield a fixed point for
every continuous function $\mu:2\to 2$ (where 2 denotes the set $\{0,1\}$),
while for the other CPO's we cannot invoke that theorem to yield such fixed
points. Every element of each of these CPO's is a binary string in the
monotypic form and we show that invalidation of the applicability of the FPT to
the CPO that Scott's constructed yields the concept of replication.

${\bbbg(n,p)}$ is investigated in this paper. It is shown this phenomenon
possesses a phase transition. Namely, we have argued that, given a constant
probability $p$, an $n$-node random graph $G$ from ${\bbbg(n,p)}$ and for $r= c
\log_{1/p} n$ with $1 \leq c \leq 2$, it holds: (1) if $p &gt; 1/2$ then an
$r$-node clique is dominating in $G$ almost surely and, (2) if $p \leq (3 -
\sqrt{5})/2$ then an $r$-node clique is not dominating in $G$ almost surely.
The remaining range of probability $p$ is discussed with more attention. A
detailed study shows that this problem is answered by examination of
sub-logarithmic growth of $r$ upon $n$.

Invited survey for The Bulletin of the European Association

role in complexity theory. Typically, one is interested in the least degree of
a polynomial p(x_1,...,x_n) that approximates or sign-represents a given
Boolean function f(x_1,...,x_n). This article surveys a new and growing body of
work in communication complexity that centers around the dual objects, i.e.,
polynomials that certify the difficulty of approximating or sign-representing a
given function. We provide a unified guide to the following results, complete
with all the key proofs:
  (1) Sherstov's Degree/Discrepancy Theorem, which translates lower bounds on
the threshold degree of a Boolean function into upper bounds on the discrepancy
of a related function;
  (2) Two different methods for proving lower bounds on bounded-error
communication based on the approximate degree: Sherstov's pattern matrix method
and Shi and Zhu's block composition method;
  (3) Extension of the pattern matrix method to the multiparty model, obtained
by Lee and Shraibman and by Chattopadhyay and Ada, and the resulting improved
lower bounds for DISJOINTNESS;
  (4) David and Pitassi's separation of NP and BPP in multiparty communication
complexity for k=(1-eps)log n players.

University of Waterloo Technical Report</comments><report-no>Technical Report UW-E&amp;CE#2008-09</report-no><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Path diversity works by setting up multiple parallel connections between the
end points using the topological path redundancy of the network. In this paper,
\textit{Forward Error Correction} (FEC) is applied across multiple independent
paths to enhance the end-to-end reliability. Network paths are modeled as
erasure Gilbert-Elliot channels. It is known that over any erasure channel,
\textit{Maximum Distance Separable} (MDS) codes achieve the minimum probability
of irrecoverable loss among all block codes of the same size. Based on the
adopted model for the error behavior, we prove that the probability of
irrecoverable loss for MDS codes decays exponentially for an asymptotically
large number of paths. Then, optimal rate allocation problem is solved for the
asymptotic case where the number of paths is large. Moreover, it is shown that
in such asymptotically optimal rate allocation, each path is assigned a
positive rate \textit{iff} its quality is above a certain threshold. The
quality of a path is defined as the percentage of the time it spends in the bad
state. Finally, using dynamic programming, a heuristic suboptimal algorithm
with polynomial runtime is proposed for rate allocation over a finite number of
paths. This algorithm converges to the asymptotically optimal rate allocation
when the number of paths is large. The simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm approximates the optimal rate allocation (found by
exhaustive search) very closely for practical number of paths, and provides
significant performance improvement compared to the alternative schemes of rate
allocation.

  Graphs</title><categories>cs.DM cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A graphical realization of a linear code C consists of an assignment of the
coordinates of C to the vertices of a graph, along with a specification of
linear state spaces and linear ``local constraint'' codes to be associated with
the edges and vertices, respectively, of the graph. The $\k$-complexity of a
graphical realization is defined to be the largest dimension of any of its
local constraint codes. $\k$-complexity is a reasonable measure of the
computational complexity of a sum-product decoding algorithm specified by a
graphical realization. The main focus of this paper is on the following
problem: given a linear code C and a graph G, how small can the $\k$-complexity
of a realization of C on G be? As useful tools for attacking this problem, we
introduce the Vertex-Cut Bound, and the notion of ``vc-treewidth'' for a graph,
which is closely related to the well-known graph-theoretic notion of treewidth.
Using these tools, we derive tight lower bounds on the $\k$-complexity of any
realization of C on G. Our bounds enable us to conclude that good
error-correcting codes can have low-complexity realizations only on graphs with
large vc-treewidth. Along the way, we also prove the interesting result that
the ratio of the $\k$-complexity of the best conventional trellis realization
of a length-n code C to the $\k$-complexity of the best cycle-free realization
of C grows at most logarithmically with codelength n. Such a logarithmic growth
rate is, in fact, achievable.

the received packets easily and an eavesdropper is unable to get any meaningful
information about the source. We call it practical security if an eavesdropper
is unable to get any meaningful information about the source.We show that, by
giving up a small amount of overall capacity, our algorithm achieves achieves
the practically secure condition at a probability of one. Furthermore, the
communication overhead of our algorithm are negligible compared with previous
works, since the transmission of the hash values and the code coefficients are
both avoided.

improved bilateral filtering method was proposed which can remove noise with
edge preserving. Firstly the steerable filtering decomposition is used to
calculate the sub-band parameters of 4 orients, and the texture feature matrix
is then obtained from the sub-band local median energy. The texture similar,
the spatial closer and the color similar functions are used to filter the
image.The effect of the weighting function parameters is qualitatively analyzed
also. In contrast with the standard bilateral filter and the simulation results
for the real airport runway image show that the multilateral filtering is more
effective than the standard bilateral filtering.

to design statistical tests to determine if two samples are drawn from
different distributions. Our test statistic is the largest difference in
expectations over functions in the unit ball of a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS). We present two tests based on large deviation bounds for the test
statistic, while a third is based on the asymptotic distribution of this
statistic. The test statistic can be computed in quadratic time, although
efficient linear time approximations are available. Several classical metrics
on distributions are recovered when the function space used to compute the
difference in expectations is allowed to be more general (eg. a Banach space).
We apply our two-sample tests to a variety of problems, including attribute
matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform
strongly. Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions
over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.

extension to congestion games where players might act in a malicious way. In
such a game each player has two types. Either the player is a rational player
seeking to minimize her own delay, or - with a certain probability - the player
is malicious in which case her only goal is to disturb the other players as
much as possible.
  We show that such games do in general not possess a Bayesian Nash equilibrium
in pure strategies (i.e. a pure Bayesian Nash equilibrium). Moreover, given a
game, we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether it admits a pure
Bayesian Nash equilibrium. This result even holds when resource latency
functions are linear, each player is malicious with the same probability, and
all strategy sets consist of singleton sets. For a slightly more restricted
class of malicious Bayesian congestion games, we provide easy checkable
properties that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a pure
Bayesian Nash equilibrium.
  In the second part of the paper we study the impact of the malicious types on
the overall performance of the system (i.e. the social cost). To measure this
impact, we use the Price of Malice. We provide (tight) bounds on the Price of
Malice for an interesting class of malicious Bayesian congestion games.
Moreover, we show that for certain congestion games the advent of malicious
types can also be beneficial to the system in the sense that the social cost of
the worst case equilibrium decreases. We provide a tight bound on the maximum
factor by which this happens.

  Mutual Information using MMSE Decision Feedback Detection</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper, we consider the joint design of the transceivers for a
multiple access Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) system having
Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) channels. The system we consider is equipped
with the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) Decision-Feedback (DF) detector.
Traditionally, transmitter designs for this system have been based on
constraints of either the transmission power or the
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for each user. Here, we explore a
novel perspective and examine a transceiver design which is based on a fixed
sum mutual information constraint and minimizes the arithmetic average of mean
square error of MMSE-decision feedback detection. For this optimization
problem, a closed-form solution is obtained and is achieved if and only if the
averaged sum mutual information is uniformly distributed over each active
subchannel. Meanwhile, the mutual information of the currently detected user is
uniformly distributed over each individual symbol within the block signal of
the user, assuming all the previous user signals have been perfectly detected.

communicate across a noisy channel. The classical information-theoretic
approach neglects the energy expended in processing the data at the encoder and
the decoder and only minimizes the energy required for transmissions. Since
there is no cost associated with using more degrees of freedom, the
traditionally optimal strategy is to communicate at rate zero.
  In this work, we use our recently proposed model for the power consumed by
iterative message passing. Using generalized sphere-packing bounds on the
decoding power, we find lower bounds on the total energy consumed in the
transmissions and the decoding, allowing for freedom in the choice of the rate.
We show that contrary to the classical intuition, the rate for green codes is
bounded away from zero for any given error probability. In fact, as the desired
bit-error probability goes to zero, the optimizing rate for our bounds
converges to 1.

of $\gamma$-left regular LDPC codes when decoded using the bit flipping (serial
and parallel) algorithms is investigated. A lower bound on the size of variable
node sets which expand by a factor of at least $3 \gamma/4$ is found based on
the Moore bound. An upper bound on the guaranteed error correction capability
is established by studying the sizes of smallest possible trapping sets. The
results are extended to generalized LDPC codes. It is shown that generalized
LDPC codes can correct a linear fraction of errors under the parallel bit
flipping algorithm when the underlying Tanner graph is a good expander. It is
also shown that the bound cannot be improved when $\gamma$ is even by studying
a class of trapping sets. A lower bound on the size of variable node sets which
have the required expansion is established.

for game graphs with $n$ states and $m$ edges. For game graphs with constant
outdegree, the best known algorithm has running time $O(n^2/\log n)$. We
present two new algorithms for B\&quot;uchi games. First, we give an algorithm that
performs at most $O(m)$ more work than the classical algorithm, but runs in
time O(n) on infinitely many graphs of constant outdegree on which the
classical algorithm requires time $O(n^2)$. Second, we give an algorithm with
running time $O(n\cdot m\cdot\log\delta(n)/\log n)$, where $1\le\delta(n)\le n$
is the outdegree of the game graph. Note that this algorithm performs
asymptotically better than the classical algorithm if $\delta(n)=O(\log n)$.

  Stochastic Logical Effort (ISLE)</title><categories>cs.OH</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In the nano era in integrated circuit fabrication technologies, the
performance variability due to statistical process and circuit parameter
variations is becoming more and more significant. Considerable effort has been
expended in the EDA community during the past several years in trying to cope
with the so-called statistical timing problem. Most of this effort has been
aimed at generalizing the static timing analyzers to the statistical case. In
this paper, we take a pragmatic approach in pursuit of making the Monte Carlo
method for timing yield estimation practically feasible. The Monte Carlo method
is widely used as a golden reference in assessing the accuracy of other timing
yield estimation techniques. However, it is generally believed that it can not
be used in practice for estimating timing yield as it requires too many costly
full circuit simulations for acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to constructing an improvedMonte Carlo estimator for timing
yield which provides the same accuracy as the standard Monte Carlo estimator,
but at a cost of much fewer full circuit simulations. This improved estimator
is based on a novel combination of a variance reduction technique, importance
sampling, and a stochastic generalization of the logical effort formalism for
cheap but approximate delay estimation. The results we present demonstrate that
our improved yield estimator achieves the same accuracy as the standard Monte
Carlo estimator at a cost reduction reaching several orders of magnitude.

  Cancellation Group Decoding</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>45 pages, 3 figures, partially appeared in the International Symp. on
  Information Theory (ISIT), Toronto, Canada, July 6-11, 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper, we propose a partial interference cancellation (PIC) group
decoding for linear dispersive space-time block codes (STBC) and a design
criterion for the codes to achieve full diversity when the PIC group decoding
is used at the receiver. A PIC group decoding decodes the symbols embedded in
an STBC by dividing them into several groups and decoding each group separately
after a linear PIC operation is implemented. It can be viewed as an
intermediate decoding between the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver that decodes
all the embedded symbols together, i.e., all the embedded symbols are in a
single group, and the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver that decodes all the embedded
symbols separately and independently, i.e., each group has and only has one
embedded symbol, after the ZF operation is implemented. Our proposed design
criterion for the PIC group decoding to achieve full diversity is an
intermediate condition between the loosest ML full rank criterion of codewords
and the strongest ZF linear independence condition of the column vectors in the
equivalent channel matrix. We also propose asymptotically optimal (AO) group
decoding algorithm, which is an intermediate decoding between the MMSE decoding
algorithm and the ML decoding algorithm. The design criterion for the PIC group
decoding applies to the AO group decoding algorithm. It is well-known that the
symbol rate for a full rank linear STBC can be full, i.e., n_t for n_t transmit
antennas. It has been recently shown that its rate is upper bounded by 1 if a
code achieves full diversity with a linear receiver. The intermediate criterion
proposed in this paper provides the possibility for codes of rates between n_t
and 1 that achieve full diversity with a PIC group decoding. This therefore
provides a complexity-performance-rate tradeoff.

trade-off between exploration, or learning about the state of a system, and
exploitation, or utilizing the system. In this paper we study the variant of
the multi-armed bandit problem where the exploration phase involves costly
experiments and occurs before the exploitation phase; and where each play of an
arm during the exploration phase updates a prior belief about the arm. The
problem of finding an inexpensive exploration strategy to optimize a certain
exploitation objective is NP-Hard even when a single play reveals all
information about an arm, and all exploration steps cost the same.
  We provide the first polynomial time constant-factor approximation algorithm
for this class of problems. We show that this framework also generalizes
several problems of interest studied in the context of data acquisition in
sensor networks. Our analyses also extends to switching and setup costs, and to
concave utility objectives.
  Our solution approach is via a novel linear program rounding technique based
on stochastic packing. In addition to yielding exploration policies whose
performance is within a small constant factor of the adaptive optimal policy, a
nice feature of this approach is that the resulting policies explore the arms
sequentially without revisiting any arm. Sequentiality is a well-studied
concept in decision theory, and is very desirable in domains where multiple
explorations can be conducted in parallel, for instance, in the sensor network
context.

source, two parallel half-duplex relays and a destination. In a single antenna
configuration, it has been previously shown that a two-phase node-scheduling
algorithm, along with the decode and forward strategy can achieve the capacity
of the diamond channel for a certain symmetric channel gains [1]. In this
paper, we obtain a more general condition for the optimality of the scheme in
terms of power resources and channel gains. In particular, it is proved that if
the product of the capacity of the simultaneously active links are equal in
both transmission phases, the scheme achieves the capacity of the channel.

approximates within a specified accuracy $\epsilon$ the Pareto curve of a
multiobjective optimization problem. We show that for a broad class of
bi-objective problems (containing many important widely studied problems such
as shortest paths, spanning tree, and many others), we can compute in
polynomial time an $\epsilon$-Pareto set that contains at most twice as many
solutions as the minimum such set. Furthermore we show that the factor of 2 is
tight for these problems, i.e., it is NP-hard to do better. We present upper
and lower bounds for three or more objectives, as well as for the dual problem
of computing a specified number $k$ of solutions which provide a good
approximation to the Pareto curve.

  Control Problem</title><categories>cs.NI cs.NA</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Achieving weighted throughput maximization (WTM) through power control has
been a long standing open problem in interference-limited wireless networks.
The complicated coupling between the mutual interferences of links gives rise
to a non-convex optimization problem. Previous work has considered the WTM
problem in the high signal to interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) regime, where
the problem can be approximated and transformed into a convex optimization
problem through proper change of variables. In the general SINR regime,
however, the approximation and transformation approach does not work. This
paper proposes an algorithm, MAPEL, which globally converges to a global
optimal solution of the WTM problem in the general SINR regime. The MAPEL
algorithm is designed based on three key observations of the WTM problem: (1)
the objective function is monotonically increasing in SINR, (2) the objective
function can be transformed into a product of exponentiated linear fraction
functions, and (3) the feasible set of the equivalent transformed problem is
always normal although not necessarily convex. The MAPLE algorithm finds the
desired optimal power control solution by constructing a series of polyblocks
that approximate the feasible SINR region in increasing precision. Furthermore,
by tuning the approximation factor in MAPEL, we could engineer a desirable
tradeoff between optimality and convergence time. MAPEL provides an important
benchmark for performance evaluation of other heuristic algorithms targeting
the same problem. With the help of MAPEL, we evaluate the performance of
several respective algorithms through extensive simulations.

of $n$ points on the plane, so that given a polygon query, the subset of points
lying inside it can be reported efficiently.
  It is of great interest in areas such as Computer Graphics, CAD applications,
Spatial Databases and GIS developing tasks. In this paper we study the problem
of canonical $k$-vertex polygon queries on the plane. A canonical $k$-vertex
polygon query always meets the following specific property: a point retrieval
query can be transformed into a linear number (with respect to the number of
vertices) of point retrievals for orthogonal objects such as rectangles and
triangles (throughout this work we call a triangle orthogonal iff two of its
edges are axis-parallel).
  We present two new algorithms for this problem. The first one requires
$O(n\log^2{n})$ space and $O(k\frac{log^3n}{loglogn}+A)$ query time. A simple
modification scheme on first algorithm lead us to a second solution, which
consumes $O(n^2)$ space and $O(k \frac{logn}{loglogn}+A)$ query time, where $A$
denotes the size of the answer and $k$ is the number of vertices.
  The best previous solution for the general polygon retrieval problem uses
$O(n^2)$ space and answers a query in $O(k\log{n}+A)$ time, where $k$ is the
number of vertices. It is also very complicated and difficult to be implemented
in a standard imperative programming language such as C or C++.

devices will be built from vast numbers of densely arranged devices that
exhibit high failure rates. Other than that, there is little consensus on what
type of technology and computing architecture holds most promises to go far
beyond today's top-down engineered silicon devices. Cellular automata (CA) have
been proposed in the past as a possible class of architectures to the von
Neumann computing architecture, which is not generally well suited for future
parallel and fine-grained nanoscale electronics. While the top-down engineered
semi-conducting technology favors regular and locally interconnected
structures, future bottom-up self-assembled devices tend to have irregular
structures because of the current lack precise control over these processes. In
this paper, we will assess random dynamical networks, namely Random Boolean
Networks (RBNs) and Random Threshold Networks (RTNs), as alternative computing
architectures and models for future information processing devices. We will
illustrate that--from a theoretical perspective--they offer superior properties
over classical CA-based architectures, such as inherent robustness as the
system scales up, more efficient information processing capabilities, and
manufacturing benefits for bottom-up designed devices, which motivates this
investigation. We will present recent results on the dynamic behavior and
robustness of such random dynamical networks while also including manufacturing
issues in the assessment.

computable, increasing sequence of rational numbers which converges to \alpha.
The randomness of a recursively enumerable real \alpha can be characterized in
various ways using each of the notions; program-size complexity, Martin-L\&quot;{o}f
test, Chaitin's \Omega number, the domination and \Omega-likeness of \alpha,
the universality of a computable, increasing sequence of rational numbers which
converges to \alpha, and universal probability. In this paper, we generalize
these characterizations of randomness over the notion of partial randomness by
parameterizing each of the notions above by a real number T\in(0,1]. We thus
present several equivalent characterizations of partial randomness for a
recursively enumerable real number.

$x \in G$ from given $g \in G$ and $h=x^{-1}gx$. The alleged computational
hardness of this problem in some groups was used in several recently suggested
public key exchange protocols, including the one due to Anshel, Anshel, and
Goldfeld, and the one due to Ko, Lee et al. Sibert, Dehornoy, and Girault used
this problem in their authentication scheme, which was inspired by the
Fiat-Shamir scheme involving repeating several times a three-pass
challenge-response step.
  In this paper, we offer an authentication scheme whose security is based on
the apparent hardness of the twisted conjugacy search problem, which is: given
a pair of endomorphisms (i.e., homomorphisms into itself) phi, \psi of a group
G and a pair of elements w, t \in G, find an element s \in G such that t =
\psi(s^{-1}) w \phi(s) provided at least one such s exists. This problem
appears to be very non-trivial even for free groups. We offer here another
platform, namely, the semigroup of all 2x2 matrices over truncated one-variable
polynomials over F_2, the field of two elements, with transposition used
instead of inversion in the equality above.

noise whose adimensional strength is controlled by the parameter a, and analyze
the topological and metrical properties of the resulting Voronoi Tessellations
(VT). The topological properties of the VT of the SC and FCC crystals are
unstable with respect to the introduction of noise, because the corresponding
polyhedra are geometrically degenerate, whereas the tessellation of the BCC
crystal is topologically stable even against noise of small but finite
intensity. For weak noise, the mean area of the perturbed BCC and FCC crystals
VT increases quadratically with a. In the case of perturbed SCC crystals, there
is an optimal amount of noise that minimizes the mean area of the cells.
Already for a moderate noise (a&gt;0.5), the properties of the three perturbed VT
are indistinguishable, and for intense noise (a&gt;2), results converge to the
Poisson-VT limit. Notably, 2-parameter gamma distributions are an excellent
model for the empirical of of all considered properties. The VT of the
perturbed BCC and FCC structures are local maxima for the isoperimetric
quotient, which measures the degre of sphericity of the cells, among space
filling VT. In the BCC case, this suggests a weaker form of the recentluy
disproved Kelvin conjecture. Due to the fluctuations of the shape of the cells,
anomalous scalings with exponents &gt;3/2 is observed between the area and the
volumes of the cells, and, except for the FCC case, also for a-&gt;0. In the
Poisson-VT limit, the exponent is about 1.67. As the number of faces is
positively correlated with the sphericity of the cells, the anomalous scaling
is heavily reduced when we perform powerlaw fits separately on cells with a
specific number of faces.

broader family of large margin classifiers which we collectively call the
Margitron. The Margitron, (despite its) sharing the same update rule with the
Perceptron, is shown in an incremental setting to converge in a finite number
of updates to solutions possessing any desirable fraction of the maximum
margin. Experiments comparing the Margitron with decomposition SVMs on tasks
involving linear kernels and 2-norm soft margin are also reported.

correction. The sample bias correction technique commonly used in machine
learning consists of reweighting the cost of an error on each training point of
a biased sample to more closely reflect the unbiased distribution. This relies
on weights derived by various estimation techniques based on finite samples. We
analyze the effect of an error in that estimation on the accuracy of the
hypothesis returned by the learning algorithm for two estimation techniques: a
cluster-based estimation technique and kernel mean matching. We also report the
results of sample bias correction experiments with several data sets using
these techniques. Our analysis is based on the novel concept of distributional
stability which generalizes the existing concept of point-based stability. Much
of our work and proof techniques can be used to analyze other importance
weighting techniques and their effect on accuracy when using a distributionally
stable algorithm.

finite pi-calculus within a logic that contains the nabla quantifier for
encoding generic judgments and definitions for encoding fixed points. Since we
restrict to the finite case, the ability of the logic to unfold fixed points
allows this logic to be complete for both the inductive nature of operational
semantics and the coinductive nature of bisimulation. The nabla quantifier
helps with the delicate issues surrounding the scope of variables within
pi-calculus expressions and their executions (proofs). We illustrate several
merits of the logical specifications permitted by this logic: they are natural
and declarative; they contain no side-conditions concerning names of variables
while maintaining a completely formal treatment of such variables; differences
between late and open bisimulation relations arise from familar logic
distinctions; the interplay between the three quantifiers (for all, exists, and
nabla) and their scopes can explain the differences between early and late
bisimulation and between various modal operators based on bound input and
output actions; and proof search involving the application of inference rules,
unification, and backtracking can provide complete proof systems for one-step
transitions, bisimulation, and satisfaction in modal logic. We also illustrate
how one can encode the pi-calculus with replications, in an extended logic with
induction and co-induction.

for nonbinary codes mapped to PSK constellations for transmission over
memoryless channels such as AWGN channels or flat fading channels with AWGN.

communication are leading to a new generation of engineered systems called
cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS promises to transform the way we interact
with the physical world just as the Internet transformed how we interact with
one another. Before this vision becomes a reality, however, a large number of
challenges have to be addressed. Network quality of service (QoS) management in
this new realm is among those issues that deserve extensive research efforts.
It is envisioned that wireless sensor/actuator networks (WSANs) will play an
essential role in CPS. This paper examines the main characteristics of WSANs
and the requirements of QoS provisioning in the context of cyber-physical
computing. Several research topics and challenges are identified. As a sample
solution, a feedback scheduling framework is proposed to tackle some of the
identified challenges. A simple example is also presented that illustrates the
effectiveness of the proposed solution.

density homogeneous hyperplane separator of an unknown probability
distribution. This task is relevant to several problems in machine learning,
such as semi-supervised learning and clustering stability. We investigate the
question of existence of a universally consistent algorithm for this problem.
We propose two natural learning paradigms and prove that, on input unlabeled
random samples generated by any member of a rich family of distributions, they
are guaranteed to converge to the optimal separator for that distribution. We
complement this result by showing that no learning algorithm for our task can
achieve uniform learning rates (that are independent of the data generating
distribution).

creating covert channels for VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) streams. Apart
from characterizing existing steganographic methods we provide new insights by
presenting two new techniques. The first one is network steganography solution
which exploits free/unused protocols' fields and is known for IP, UDP or TCP
protocols but has never been applied to RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) and
RTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol) which are characteristic for VoIP. The second
method, called LACK (Lost Audio Packets Steganography), provides hybrid
storage-timing covert channel by utilizing delayed audio packets. The results
of the experiment, that was performed to estimate a total amount of data that
can be covertly transferred during typical VoIP conversation phase, regardless
of steganalysis, are also included in this paper.

number of metrics; including integer/float operations, memory throughput
(STREAM) and communication latencies. Furthermore, the spread of performance
does not appear to follow any known distribution pattern, which is demonstrated
in graphs produced during May 2007 measurements. It is implied that the current
practice where either &quot;all-WNs-are-equal&quot; or, the alternative of SPEC-based
rating used by LCG/EGEE is an oversimplification which is inappropriate and
expensive from an operational point of view, therefore new techniques are
needed for optimal grid resources allocation.

correlated side information is considered. First, a joint source-channel
decode-and-forward scheme is proposed for general discrete memoryless sources
and channels. Then the Gaussian relay channel where the source and the side
information are jointly Gaussian is analyzed. For this Gaussian model, several
new source-channel cooperation schemes are introduced and analyzed in terms of
the squared-error distortion at the destination. A comparison of the proposed
upper bounds with the cut-set lower bound is given, and it is seen that joint
source-channel cooperation improves the reconstruction quality significantly.
Moreover, the performance of the joint code is close to the lower bound on
distortion for a wide range of source and channel parameters.

  without loss of statistical efficiency</title><categories>stat.ML cs.IT math.IT</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We consider the problem of estimating the support of a vector $\beta^* \in
\mathbb{R}^{p}$ based on observations contaminated by noise. A significant body
of work has studied behavior of $\ell_1$-relaxations when applied to
measurement matrices drawn from standard dense ensembles (e.g., Gaussian,
Bernoulli). In this paper, we analyze \emph{sparsified} measurement ensembles,
and consider the trade-off between measurement sparsity, as measured by the
fraction $\gamma$ of non-zero entries, and the statistical efficiency, as
measured by the minimal number of observations $n$ required for exact support
recovery with probability converging to one. Our main result is to prove that
it is possible to let $\gamma \to 0$ at some rate, yielding measurement
matrices with a vanishing fraction of non-zeros per row while retaining the
same statistical efficiency as dense ensembles. A variety of simulation results
confirm the sharpness of our theoretical predictions.

properties of SAT at arXiv:0802.1790 that will allow us to define and discuss
the &quot;complete internal independence&quot; of a decision problem. This property is
strictly stronger than the independence property that was called &quot;strong
internal independence&quot; in cited paper. We show that SAT exhibits this property.
We argue that this form of independence of a decision problem is the strongest
possible for a problem. By relying upon this maximally strong form of internal
independence, we reformulate in more strict terms the informal remarks on
possible exponentiality of SAT that concluded our previous paper. The net
result of that reformulation is a hint for a proof for SAT being exponential.
We conjecture that a complete proof of that proposition can be obtained by
strictly following the line of given hint of proof.

system may be jeopardized in dynamic environments with variable workload. This
gives rise to the increasing demand of co-design of control and scheduling. To
deal with uncertainties in resource availability, a fuzzy feedback scheduling
(FFS) scheme is proposed in this paper. Within the framework of feedback
scheduling, the sampling periods of control loops are dynamically adjusted
using the fuzzy control technique. The feedback scheduler provides QoC
guarantees in dynamic environments through maintaining the CPU utilization at a
desired level. The framework and design methodology of the proposed FFS scheme
are described in detail. A simplified mobile robot target tracking system is
investigated as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
FFS scheme. The scheme is independent of task execution times, robust to
measurement noises, and easy to implement, while incurring only a small
overhead.

  Information and Control</comments><acm-class>C.3; D.4.1</acm-class><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Many embedded real-time control systems suffer from resource constraints and
dynamic workload variations. Although optimal feedback scheduling schemes are
in principle capable of maximizing the overall control performance of
multitasking control systems, most of them induce excessively large
computational overheads associated with the mathematical optimization routines
involved and hence are not directly applicable to practical systems. To
optimize the overall control performance while minimizing the overhead of
feedback scheduling, this paper proposes an efficient feedback scheduling
scheme based on feedforward neural networks. Using the optimal solutions
obtained offline by mathematical optimization methods, a back-propagation (BP)
neural network is designed to adapt online the sampling periods of concurrent
control tasks with respect to changes in computing resource availability.
Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the
computational overhead significantly while delivering almost the same overall
control performance as compared to optimal feedback scheduling.

stationary process can be inferred from finite but growing segments of the
past. Several schemes are known for constructing pointwise consistent
estimates, but they all demand prohibitive amounts of input data. In this paper
we consider real-valued time series and construct conditional distribution
estimates that make much more efficient use of the input data. The estimates
are consistent in a weak sense, and the question whether they are pointwise
consistent is still open. For finite-alphabet processes one may rely on a
universal data compression scheme like the Lempel-Ziv algorithm to construct
conditional probability mass function estimates that are consistent in expected
information divergence. Consistency in this strong sense cannot be attained in
a universal sense for all stationary processes with values in an infinite
alphabet, but weak consistency can. Some applications of the estimates to
on-line forecasting, regression and classification are discussed.

sequence. The algorithm uses ideas from recent developments of the theory of
the prediction of individual sequences. We show that if the sequence is a
realization of a stationary and ergodic random process then the average number
of mistakes converges, almost surely, to that of the optimum, given by the
Bayes predictor. The desirable finite-sample properties of the predictor are
illustrated by its performance for Markov processes. In such cases the
predictor exhibits near optimal behavior even without knowing the order of the
Markov process. Prediction with side information is also considered.

phase shift keying (PSK) constellations by exploiting linear congruence
equation theory: the one for factorizing a $pq$-PSK constellation into a
product of a $p$-PSK constellation and a $q$-PSK constellation, and the other
for decomposing a specific complex number into a difference of a $p$-PSK
constellation and a $q$-PSK constellation. With this, we propose a simple
signal design technique to blindly and uniquely identify frequency selective
channels with zero-padded block transmission under noise-free environments by
only using the first two block received signal vectors. Furthermore, a
closed-form solution to determine the transmitted signals and the channel
coefficients is obtained. In the Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading
environment, we prove that the newly proposed signaling scheme enables
non-coherent full diversity for the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT)
receiver.

customers to achieve large changes in behaviour. Models of influence spread
have been studied in a number of domains, including the effect of &quot;word of
mouth&quot; in the promotion of new products or the diffusion of technologies. A
social network can be represented by a graph where the nodes are individuals
and the edges indicate a form of social relationship. The flow of influence
through this network can be thought of as an increasing process of active
nodes: as individuals become aware of new technologies, they have the potential
to pass them on to their neighbours. The goal of marketing is to trigger a
large cascade of adoptions. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that
allows to analyze the dynamics of the cascading sequence of nodes switching to
the new technology. To this end we describe a continuous-time and a
discrete-time models and analyse the proportion of nodes that adopt the new
technology over time.

nodes, to facilitate communication between a source and destination.
Previously, distributed space-time coding was used to maximize diversity gain.
Assuming a low-rate feedback link from the destination to each relay stage and
the source, this paper proposes end-to-end antenna selection strategies as an
alternative to distributed space-time coding. One-way (where only the source
has data for destination) and two-way (where the destination also has data for
the source) multi-hop relay channels are considered with both the full-duplex
and half duplex relay nodes. End-to-end antenna selection strategies are
designed and proven to achieve maximum diversity gain by using a single antenna
path (using single antenna of the source, each relay stage and the destination)
with the maximum signal-to-noise ratio at the destination. For the half-duplex
case, two single antenna paths with the two best signal-to-noise ratios in
alternate time slots are used to overcome the rate loss with half-duplex nodes,
with a small diversity gain penalty. Finally to answer the question, whether to
code (distributed space-time code) or not (the proposed end-to-end antenna
selection strategy) in a multi-hop relay channel, end-to-end antenna selection
strategy and distributed space-time coding is compared with respect to several
important performance metrics.

rather to focus on the adequacy of reusing standard system architecting

detection and safety issues in large-scale coupled systems that definitely
qualify as SoS, whatever the definition is. A key issue will be to secure the
availability of the services provided by the SoS despite the evolution of the
various systems composing the SoS. We will also tackle contracting issues and
responsibility transfers, as they should be addressed to ensure the expected
behavior of the SoS whilst the various independently contracted systems evolve
asynchronously.

the product distribution of the private observations. This paper proves that
the bound is tight for the important case when all users are active, using the
polymatroidal structure[6] underlying the source coding problem. When some
users are not active, the bound may not be tight. This paper gives a
counter-example in which 3 out of the 6 terminals are active.

where image features (e.g. intensity) are random variables whose distribution
belongs to some parametric family (e.g. exponential) rather than confining
ourselves to the special Gaussian case. Using shape derivation tools, our
effort focuses on constructing a general expression for the derivative of the
energy (with respect to a domain) and derive the corresponding evolution speed.
A general result is stated within the framework of multi-parameter exponential
family. More particularly, when using Maximum Likelihood estimators, the
evolution speed has a closed-form expression that depends simply on the
probability density function, while complicating additive terms appear when
using other estimators, e.g. moments method. Experimental results on both
synthesized and real images demonstrate the applicability of our approach.

region-based active contours. On the one hand, we use the general framework of
exponential family as a prior model for noise. On the other hand, translation
and scale invariant Legendre moments are considered to incorporate the shape
prior (e.g. fidelity to a reference shape). The combination of the two prior
terms in the active contour functional yields the final evolution equation
whose evolution speed is rigorously derived using shape derivative tools.
Experimental results on both synthetic images and real life cardiac echography
data clearly demonstrate the robustness to initialization and noise,
flexibility and large potential applicability of our segmentation algorithm.

Event-B and Alloy are two formal specification languages based on fairly
different methodologies. While Event-B uses theorem provers to prove that
invariants hold for a given specification, Alloy uses a SAT-based model finder.
In some settings, Event-B invariants may not be proved automatically, and so
the often difficult step of interactive proof is required. One solution for
this problem is to validate invariants with model checking. This work studies
the encoding of Event-B machines and contexts to Alloy in order to perform
temporal model checking with Alloy's SAT-based engine.

general evaluation framework for soft constraint satisfaction problems (soft
CSPs). DRLs are in fact natural candidates for this role, since they form the
algebraic semantics of a large family of substructural and fuzzy logics.
  We present the following results. (i) We show that DRLs subsume important
valuation structures for soft constraints, such as commutative idempotent
semirings and fair valuation structures, in the sense that the last two are
members of certain subvarieties of DRLs (namely, Heyting algebras and
BL-algebras respectively). (ii) In the spirit of previous work of J. Larrosa
and T. Schiex [2004], and S. Bistarelli and F. Gadducci [2006] we describe a
polynomial-time algorithm that enforces k-hyperarc consistency on soft CSPs
evaluated over DRLs. Observed that, in general, DRLs are neither idempotent nor
totally ordered, this algorithm amounts to a generalization of the available
algorithms that enforce k-hyperarc consistency.

in those cases where random access is not required. Using this technique,
compression and decompression can be done in linear time in the size of the BDD
and compression will in many cases reduce the size of the BDD to 1-2 bits per
node. Empirical results for our compression technique are presented, including
comparisons with previously introduced techniques, showing that the new
technique dominate on all tested instances.

mostly on sequential input/output. Bitmaps can be compressed to reduce
input/output costs and minimize CPU usage. The most efficient compression
techniques are based on run-length encoding (RLE), such as Word-Aligned Hybrid
(WAH) compression. This type of compression accelerates logical operations
(AND, OR) over the bitmaps. However, run-length encoding is sensitive to the
order of the facts. Thus, we propose to sort the fact tables. We review
lexicographic, Gray-code, and block-wise sorting. We found that a lexicographic
sort improves compression--sometimes generating indexes twice as small--and
make indexes several times faster. While sorting takes time, this is partially
offset by the fact that it is faster to index a sorted table. Column order is
significant: it is generally preferable to put the columns having more distinct
values at the beginning. A block-wise sort is much less efficient than a full
sort. Moreover, we found that Gray-code sorting is not better than
lexicographic sorting when using word-aligned compression.

geostationary orbit. And many of them were designed in prolate dual-spin
configuration. As a prolate dual-spin vehicle, they have to be stabilized
against their internal energy dissipation effect. Several countries that
located in southern hemisphere, has shown interest to use communication
satellite. Because of those countries southern latitude, an idea emerged to
incline the communication satellite (due to its prolate dualspin configuration)
in elliptical orbit. This work is focused on designing Attitude Stability
System for prolate dual-spin satellite in the effect of perturbed field of
gravity due to the inclination of its elliptical orbit. DANDE (De-spin Active
Nutation Damping Electronics) provides primary stabilization method for the
satellite in its orbit. Classical Control Approach is used for the iteration of
DANDE parameters. The control performance is evaluated based on time response
analysis.

signals of a linear vector channel, which is an extension of code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) or multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, in
the large system limit, is presented in this paper. Here the dimensions of
channel input and output are both sent to infinity while their ratio remains
fixed. An optimal detector is one that uses a true channel model, true
distribution of input signals, and perfect knowledge about quantization.
Applying replica method developed in statistical mechanics, we show that, in
the case of a noiseless channel, the optimal detector has perfect detection
ability under certain conditions, and that for a noisy channel its detection
ability decreases monotonically as the quantization step size increases.

the literature, for both finite-state (module checking) and infinite-state
(pushdown module checking) systems, with respect to Ctl and Ctl*. In this
paper, we further investigate this problem with respect to the \mu-calculus
enriched with nominals and graded modalities (hybrid graded Mu-calculus), in
both the finite-state and infinite-state settings. Using an automata-theoretic
approach, we show that hybrid graded \mu-calculus module checking is solvable
in exponential time, while hybrid graded \mu-calculus pushdown module checking
is solvable in double-exponential time. These results are also tight since they
match the known lower bounds for Ctl. We also investigate the module checking
problem with respect to the hybrid graded \mu-calculus enriched with inverse
programs (Fully enriched \mu-calculus): by showing a reduction from the domino
problem, we show its undecidability. We conclude with a short overview of the
model checking problem for the Fully enriched Mu-calculus and the fragments
obtained by dropping at least one of the additional constructs.

people think and how they behave, in order to achieve his goals. In other
words, an individual may be required to adapt his behaviour by reasoning about
the others' mental state. In this paper we focus on a knowledge representation
language derived from logic programming which both supports the representation
of mental states of individual communities and provides each with the
capability of reasoning about others' mental states and acting accordingly. The
proposed semantics is shown to be translatable into stable model semantics of
logic programs with aggregates.

recently launched program for redeveloping logic as a formal theory of
computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth that logic has more
traditionally been. Formulas in it represent computational problems, &quot;truth&quot;
means existence of an algorithmic solution, and proofs encode such solutions.
Within the line of research devoted to finding axiomatizations for ever more
expressive fragments of CL, the present paper introduces a new deductive system
CL12 and proves its soundness and completeness with respect to the semantics of
CL. Conservatively extending classical predicate calculus and offering
considerable additional expressive and deductive power, CL12 presents a
reasonable, computationally meaningful, constructive alternative to classical
logic as a basis for applied theories. To obtain a model example of such
theories, this paper rebuilds the traditional, classical-logic-based Peano
arithmetic into a computability-logic-based counterpart. Among the purposes of
the present contribution is to provide a starting point for what, as the author
wishes to hope, might become a new line of research with a potential of
interesting findings -- an exploration of the presumably quite unusual
metatheory of CL-based arithmetic and other CL-based applied systems.

subspaces of the vector space $\F_q^{n}$. In this work, we consider
error-correcting codes in the projective space, focusing mainly on constant
dimension codes. We start with the different representations of subspaces in
the projective space. These representations involve matrices in reduced row
echelon form, associated binary vectors, and Ferrers diagrams. Based on these
representations, we provide a new formula for the computation of the distance
between any two subspaces in the projective space. We examine lifted maximum
rank distance (MRD) codes, which are nearly optimal constant dimension codes.
We prove that a lifted MRD code can be represented in such a way that it forms
a block design known as a transversal design. The incidence matrix of the
transversal design derived from a lifted MRD code can be viewed as a
parity-check matrix of a linear code in the Hamming space. We find the
properties of these codes which can be viewed also as LDPC codes. We present
new bounds and constructions for constant dimension codes. First, we present a
multilevel construction for constant dimension codes, which can be viewed as a
generalization of a lifted MRD codes construction. This construction is based
on a new type of rank-metric codes, called Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes.
Then we derive upper bounds on the size of constant dimension codes which
contain the lifted MRD code, and provide a construction for two families of
codes, that attain these upper bounds. We generalize the well-known concept of
a punctured code for a code in the projective space to obtain large codes which
are not constant dimension. We present efficient enumerative encoding and
decoding techniques for the Grassmannian. Finally we describe a search method
for constant dimension lexicodes.

considered, where radio power decay and interference are limiting factors. It
has been shown previously that, with simple multi-hopping, the achievable total
communication rate in such a network is at most $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$. In this
work, we study the benefit of node cooperation in conjunction with
multi-hopping on the network capacity. We propose a multi-phase communication
scheme, combining distributed MIMO transmission with multi-hop forwarding among
clusters of nodes. We derive the network throughput of this communication
scheme and determine the optimal cluster size. This provides a constructive
lower bound on the network capacity. We first show that in \textit{regular
networks} a rate of $\omega(N^{{2/3}})$ can be achieved with transmission power
scaling of $\Theta(N^{\frac{\alpha}{6}-{1/3}})$, where $\alpha&gt;2$ is the signal
path-loss exponent. We further extend this result to \textit{random networks},
where we show a rate of $\omega (N^{2/3}(\log{N})^{(2-\alpha)/6})$ can be
achieved with transmission power scaling of
$\Theta(N^{\alpha/6-1/3}(\log{N})^{-(\alpha-2)^2/6})$ in a random network with
unit node density. In particular, as $\alpha$ approaches 2, only constant
transmission power is required. Finally, we study a random network with density
$\lambda=\Omega(\log{N})$ and show that a rate of $\omega((\lambda N)^{2/3})$
is achieved and the required power scales as
$\Theta(N^{\alpha/6-1/3}/\lambda^{\alpha/3-2/3})$.

  Reliability</title><categories>cs.IT cs.CR math.IT math.PR</categories><comments>16 pages, 10 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Equivocation rate has been widely used as an information-theoretic measure of
security after Shannon[10]. It simplifies problems by removing the effect of
atypical behavior from the system. In [9], however, Merhav and Arikan
considered the alternative of using guessing exponent to analyze the Shannon's
cipher system. Because guessing exponent captures the atypical behavior, the
strongest expressible notion of secrecy requires the more stringent condition
that the size of the key, instead of its entropy rate, to be equal to the size
of the message. The relationship between equivocation and guessing exponent are
also investigated in [6][7] but it is unclear which is a better measure, and
whether there is a unifying measure of security.
  Instead of using equivocation rate or guessing exponent, we study the wiretap
channel in [2] using the success exponent, defined as the exponent of a
wiretapper successfully learn the secret after making an exponential number of
guesses to a sequential verifier that gives yes/no answer to each guess. By
extending the coding scheme in [2][5] and the converse proof in [4] with the
new Overlap Lemma 5.2, we obtain a tradeoff between secrecy and reliability
expressed in terms of lower bounds on the error and success exponents of
authorized and respectively unauthorized decoding of the transmitted messages.
  From this, we obtain an inner bound to the region of strongly achievable
public, private and guessing rate triples for which the exponents are strictly
positive. The closure of this region is equivalent to the closure of the region
in Theorem 1 of [2] when we treat equivocation rate as the guessing rate.
However, it is unclear if the inner bound is tight.

dynamic system when a variable number of noisy measurements can be taken is
here considered. Assuming a Markov evolution of the system (in particular, the
pair signal-observation forms a hidden Markov model), a sequential procedure is
proposed, wherein the detection part is a sequential probability ratio test
(SPRT) and the estimation part relies upon a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP)
criterion, gated by the detection stage (the parameter to be estimated is the
trajectory of the state evolution of the system itself). A thorough analysis of
the asymptotic behaviour of the test in this new scenario is given, and
sufficient conditions for its asymptotic optimality are stated, i.e. for almost
sure minimization of the stopping time and for (first-order) minimization of
any moment of its distribution. An application to radar surveillance problems
is also examined.

communication between nodes in a wireless mesh network. Based on the overlay
cognitive radio model, it is possible to have two concurrent transmissions in a
given interference region, where usually only one communication takes place at
a given time. We analyze the cases of wireless mesh networks with regular and
random topologies. Numerical results show that considerable network capacity
gains can be achieved.

  Analysis (WebKDD 2008)</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Many social Web sites allow users to publish content and annotate with
descriptive metadata. In addition to flat tags, some social Web sites have
recently began to allow users to organize their content and metadata
hierarchically. The social photosharing site Flickr, for example, allows users
to group related photos in sets, and related sets in collections. The social
bookmarking site Del.icio.us similarly lets users group related tags into
bundles. Although the sites themselves don't impose any constraints on how
these hierarchies are used, individuals generally use them to capture
relationships between concepts, most commonly the broader/narrower relations.
Collective annotation of content with hierarchical relations may lead to an
emergent classification system, called a folksonomy. While some researchers
have explored using tags as evidence for learning folksonomies, we believe that
hierarchical relations described above offer a high-quality source of evidence
for this task.
  We propose a simple approach to aggregate shallow hierarchies created by many
distinct Flickr users into a common folksonomy. Our approach uses statistics to
determine if a particular relation should be retained or discarded. The
relations are then woven together into larger hierarchies. Although we have not
carried out a detailed quantitative evaluation of the approach, it looks very
promising since it generates very reasonable, non-trivial hierarchies.

scripts. The practical importance of this is noted, especially the need to have
support tools for television movie writing. We use the Casablanca film script,
and scripts from six episodes of CSI (Crime Scene Investigation). For analysis
of style and structure, we quantify various central perspectives discussed in
McKee's book, &quot;Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of
Screenwriting&quot;. Film scripts offer a useful point of departure for exploration
of the analysis of more general narratives. Our methodology, using
Correspondence Analysis, and hierarchical clustering, is innovative in a range
of areas that we discuss. In particular this work is groundbreaking in taking
the qualitative analysis of McKee and grounding this analysis in a quantitative
and algorithmic framework.

  Medical Physics</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In the last year more than 70,000 people have been brought to the UK
hospitals with serious injuries. Each time a clinician has to urgently take a
patient through a screening procedure to make a reliable decision on the trauma
treatment. Typically, such procedure comprises around 20 tests; however the
condition of a trauma patient remains very difficult to be tested properly.
What happens if these tests are ambiguously interpreted, and information about
the severity of the injury will come misleading? The mistake in a decision can
be fatal: using a mild treatment can put a patient at risk of dying from
posttraumatic shock, while using an overtreatment can also cause death. How can
we reduce the risk of the death caused by unreliable decisions? It has been
shown that probabilistic reasoning, based on the Bayesian methodology of
averaging over decision models, allows clinicians to evaluate the uncertainty
in decision making. Based on this methodology, in this paper we aim at
selecting the most important screening tests, keeping a high performance. We
assume that the probabilistic reasoning within the Bayesian methodology allows
us to discover new relationships between the screening tests and uncertainty in
decisions. In practice, selection of the most informative tests can also reduce
the cost of a screening procedure in trauma care centers. In our experiments we
use the UK Trauma data to compare the efficiency of the proposed technique in
terms of the performance. We also compare the uncertainty in decisions in terms
of entropy.

  Information Theory</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The problem of error correction in both coherent and noncoherent network
coding is considered under an adversarial model. For coherent network coding,
where knowledge of the network topology and network code is assumed at the
source and destination nodes, the error correction capability of an (outer)
code is succinctly described by the rank metric; as a consequence, it is shown
that universal network error correcting codes achieving the Singleton bound can
be easily constructed and efficiently decoded. For noncoherent network coding,
where knowledge of the network topology and network code is not assumed, the
error correction capability of a (subspace) code is given exactly by a new
metric, called the injection metric, which is closely related to, but different
than, the subspace metric of K\&quot;otter and Kschischang. In particular, in the
case of a non-constant-dimension code, the decoder associated with the
injection metric is shown to correct more errors then a
minimum-subspace-distance decoder. All of these results are based on a general
approach to adversarial error correction, which could be useful for other
adversarial channels beyond network coding.

  Irregular/Sparse Codes</title><categories>cs.PF</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We propose a set of benchmarks that specifically targets a major cause of
performance degradation in high performance computing platforms: irregular
access patterns. These benchmarks are meant to be used to asses the performance
of optimizing compilers on codes with a varying degree of irregular access. The
irregularity caused by the use of pointers and indirection arrays are a major
challenge for optimizing compilers. Codes containing such patterns are
notoriously hard to optimize but they have a huge impact on the performance of
modern architectures, which are under-utilized when encountering irregular
memory accesses. In this paper, a set of benchmarks is described that
explicitly measures the performance of kernels containing a variety of
different access patterns found in real world applications. By offering a
varying degree of complexity, we provide a platform for measuring the
effectiveness of transformations. The difference in complexity stems from a
difference in traversal patterns, the use of multiple indirections and control
flow statements. The kernels used cover a variety of different access patterns,
namely pointer traversals, indirection arrays, dynamic loop bounds and run-time
dependent if-conditions. The kernels are small enough to be fully understood
which makes this benchmark set very suitable for the evaluation of
restructuring transformations.

this work we propose an original approach in order to combine binary
classifiers arising from different kinds of strategies such as one-versus-one
or one-versus-rest, usually used in the SVM-classification. The decision
functions coming from these binary classifiers are interpreted in terms of
belief functions in order to combine these functions with one of the numerous
operators of the belief functions theory. Moreover, this interpretation of the
decision function allows us to propose a process of decisions by taking into
account the rejected observations too far removed from the learning data, and
the imprecise decisions given in unions of classes. This new approach is
illustrated and evaluated with a SVM in order to classify the different kinds
of sediment on image sonar.

variables according to some criteria to distinguish or explain certain
phenomena. There are many genomic and proteomic applications which rely on
feature selection to answer questions such as: selecting signature genes which
are informative about some biological state, e.g. normal tissues and several
types of cancer; or defining a network of prediction or inference among
elements such as genes, proteins, external stimuli and other elements of
interest. In these applications, a recurrent problem is the lack of samples to
perform an adequate estimate of the joint probabilities between element states.
A myriad of feature selection algorithms and criterion functions are proposed,
although it is difficult to point the best solution in general. The intent of
this work is to provide an open-source multiplataform graphical environment to
apply, test and compare many feature selection approaches suitable to be used
in bioinformatics problems.

take an action to prevent or eradicate the terrorist attack. The intuitive
interface to visualize the intelligence data set stimulates the investigators'

attack, and to visualize it into the form of a social network diagram which
predicts the positions where the wire-pullers conceals themselves.

is that hierarchies of beliefs can be replaced by &quot;types&quot;. The types constitute
the &quot;type space&quot;. In the purely measurable framework Heifetz and Samet (1998)
formalize the concept of type spaces and prove the existence and the uniqueness
of a universal type space. Meier (2001) shows that the purely measurable
universal type space is complete, i.e., it is a consistent object. With the aim
of adding the finishing touch to these results, we will prove in this paper
that in the purely measurable framework every hierarchy of beliefs can be
represented by a unique element of the complete universal type space.

strategies which are fixed for all times. We introduce a general framework
where feedback on the current state of a network is used to dynamically alter
the values of such parameters. A specific model is analyzed where limited
resources are shared amongst arriving nodes, all vying to connect close to the
root. We show that tunable feedback leads to growth of larger, more efficient
networks. Exact results show that linear scaling of resources with system size
yields crossover to a trivial condensed state, which can be considerably
delayed with sublinear scaling.

over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. We propose a new scheme which
achieves the optimal slope of the signal-to-distortion (SDR) curve (unlike the
previously known coding schemes). Also, we propose a family of robust codes
which together maintain a bounded gap with the optimum SDR curve (in terms of
dB). To show the importance of this result, we drive some theoretical bounds on
the asymptotic performance of delay-limited hybrid digital-analog (HDA) coding
schemes. We show that, unlike the delay-unlimited case, for any family of
delay-limited HDA codes, the asymptotic performance loss is unbounded (in terms
of dB).

programming with first-class synchronization abstractions. A standard
implementation of these abstractions relies on fairly complex manipulations of
first-class continuations in the underlying language. In this paper, we present
a lightweight implementation of these abstractions in Concurrent Haskell, a
language that already provides first-order message passing. At the heart of our
implementation is a new distributed synchronization protocol. In contrast with
several previous translations of event abstractions in concurrent languages, we
remain faithful to the standard semantics for events and event combinators; for
example, we retain the symmetry of $\mathtt{choose}$ for expressing selective
communication.

the simple network proposed by R. Gray and A. Wyner in 1974. In this network, a
transmitter must reliably transport the output of two correlated information
sources to two receivers using three noiseless channels: a public channel which
connects the transmitter to both receivers, and two private channels which
connect the transmitter directly to each receiver. We extend Gray and Wyner's
original problem by permitting side information to be present at each receiver.
We derive inner and outer bounds for the achievable rate region and, for three
special cases, we show that the outer bound is tight.

sensor networks. The guiding insight of our work is that unlike an ad hoc
wireless network, a wireless ad hoc sensor network does not require full
connectivity among the nodes. As long as the sensing region is well covered by
connected nodes, the network can perform its task. We consider two kinds of
geometric random graphs as base interconnection structures: unit disk graphs
$\UDG(2,\lambda)$ and $k$-nearest-neighbor graphs $\NN(2,k)$ built on points
generated by a Poisson point process of density $\lambda$ in $\RR^2$. We
provide subgraph constructions for these two models $\US(2,\lambda)$ and
$\NS(2,k)$ and show that there are values $\lambda_s$ and $k_s$ above which
these constructions have the following good properties: (i) they are sparse;
(ii) they are power-efficient in the sense that the graph distance is no more
than a constant times the Euclidean distance between any pair of points; (iii)
they cover the space well; (iv) the subgraphs can be set up easily using local
information at each node. We also describe a simple local algorithm for routing
packets on these subgraphs. Our constructions also give new upper bounds for
the critical values of the parameters $\lambda$ and $k$ for the models
$\UDG(2,\lambda)$ and $\NN(2,k)$.

complexity class C means simply intersecting C with a uniform class L. By
contrast, the usual intensional uniformity conditions require that a
resource-bounded machine be able to exhibit the circuits in the circuit family
defining C. We say that (C,L) has the &quot;Uniformity Duality Property&quot; if the
extensionally uniform class C \cap L can be captured intensionally by means of
adding so-called &quot;L-numerical predicates&quot; to the first-order descriptive
complexity apparatus describing the connection language of the circuit family
defining C.
  This paper exhibits positive instances and negative instances of the
Uniformity Duality Property.

Acceptance is the proper social attitude for modeling Conversational Common
Ground in the particular case of goal-oriented dialog. In this paper, a
formalization of Collective Acceptance is shown, besides elements in order to
integrate this attitude in a rational model of dialog are provided; and
finally, a model of referential acts as being part of a collaborative activity
is presented. The particular case of reference has been chosen in order to
exemplify our claims.

  Networks</title><categories>cs.NI cs.DB</categories><proxy>ccsd hal-00282050</proxy><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We introduce a decentralized replication strategy for peer-to-peer file
exchange based on exhaustive exploration of the neighborhood of any node in the
network. The replication scheme lets the replicas evenly populate the network
mesh, while regulating the total number of replicas at the same time. This is
achieved by self adaptation to entering or leaving of nodes. Exhaustive
exploration is achieved by a spiral walk algorithm that generates a number of
messages linearly proportional to the number of visited nodes. It requires a
dedicated topology (a triangular mesh on a closed surface). We introduce
protocols for node connection and departure that maintain the triangular mesh
at low computational and bandwidth cost. Search efficiency is increased using a
mechanism based on dynamically allocated super peers. We conclude with a
discussion on experimental validation results.

foundation for compound Poisson approximation limit theorems (analogous to the
corresponding developments for the central limit theorem and for simple Poisson
approximation), this work examines sufficient conditions under which the
compound Poisson distribution has maximal entropy within a natural class of
probability measures on the nonnegative integers. We show that the natural
analog of the Poisson maximum entropy property remains valid if the measures
under consideration are log-concave, but that it fails in general. A parallel
maximum entropy result is established for the family of compound binomial
measures. The proofs are largely based on ideas related to the semigroup
approach introduced in recent work by Johnson for the Poisson family.
Sufficient conditions are given for compound distributions to be log-concave,
and specific examples are presented illustrating all the above results.

join and leave arbitrarily. The evaluation of new protocols in real
environments is many times practically impossible, especially at design and
testing stages. The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation
aspects of a new Java based P2P simulator that has been developed to support
scalability in the evaluation of such P2P dynamic environments. Evolving the
functionality presented by previous solutions, we provide a friendly graphical
user interface through which the high-level theoretic researcher/designer of a
P2P system can easily construct an overlay with the desirable number of nodes
and evaluate its operations using a number of key distributions. Furthermore,
the simulator has built-in ability to produce statistics about the distributed
structure. Emphasis was given to the parametrical configuration of the
simulator. As a result the developed tool can be utilized in the simulation and
evaluation procedures of a variety of different protocols, with only few
changes in the Java code.

negligible space (more precisely, o(n) bits) that, by taking advantage of the n
points in the data set permuted and stored elsewhere as a sequence, to support
geometric queries in optimal time. Our first and main result is a succinct
geometric index that can answer point location queries, a fundamental problem
in computational geometry, on planar triangulations in O(lg n) time. We also
design three variants of this index. The first supports point location using
$\lg n + 2\sqrt{\lg n} + O(\lg^{1/4} n)$ point-line comparisons. The second
supports point location in o(lg n) time when the coordinates are integers
bounded by U. The last variant can answer point location in O(H+1) expected
time, where H is the entropy of the query distribution. These results match the
query efficiency of previous point location structures that use O(n) words or
O(n lg n) bits, while saving drastic amounts of space.
  We then generalize our succinct geometric index to planar subdivisions, and
design indexes for other types of queries. Finally, we apply our techniques to
design the first implicit data structures that support point location in
$O(\lg^2 n)$ time.

an $\omega$-regular specification. Initial specifications are often
unrealizable, which means that there is no system that implements the
specification. A common reason for unrealizability is that assumptions on the
environment of the system are incomplete. We study the problem of correcting an
unrealizable specification $\phi$ by computing an environment assumption $\psi$
such that the new specification $\psi\to\phi$ is realizable. Our aim is to
construct an assumption $\psi$ that constrains only the environment and is as
weak as possible. We present a two-step algorithm for computing assumptions.
The algorithm operates on the game graph that is used to answer the
realizability question. First, we compute a safety assumption that removes a
minimal set of environment edges from the graph. Second, we compute a liveness
assumption that puts fairness conditions on some of the remaining environment
edges. We show that the problem of finding a minimal set of fair edges is
computationally hard, and we use probabilistic games to compute a locally
minimal fairness assumption.

unacceptable business and compliance risks, including errors in the financial
reporting process, spreadsheet misuse and fraud, or even significant
operational errors. These risks have been well documented and thoroughly
researched. With the advent of regulatory mandates such as SOX 404 and FDICIA
in the U.S., and MiFID, Basel II and Combined Code in the UK and Europe,
leading tax and audit firms are now recommending that organizations automate
their internal controls over critical spreadsheets and other end-user computing
applications, including Microsoft Access databases. At a minimum, auditors
mandate version control, change control and access control for operational
spreadsheets, with more advanced controls for critical financial spreadsheets.
This paper summarises the key issues regarding the establishment and
maintenance of control of Business Critical spreadsheets.

of business spreadsheet models. A methodology for structured software
development is proposed, which is based on structured analysis of data,
represented as Jackson diagrams. It is shown that this analysis allows a
straightforward modularisation, and that individual modules may be represented
with indentation in the block-structured form of structured programs. The
benefits of structured format are discussed, in terms of comprehensibility,
ease of maintenance, and reduction in errors. The capability of the methodology
to provide a modular overview in the model is described, and examples are
given. The potential for a reverse-engineering tool, to transform existing
spreadsheet models is discussed.

always well served by the built-in financial functions. Problems can arise
because of differences between UK and US practice, through anomalies in the
functions themselves, and because the promptings of Wizards' engender an
attitude of filling in the blanks on the screen, and hoping for the best. Some
examples of these problems are described, and suggestions are presented for
ways of improving the situation. Principally, it is suggested that spreadsheet
prompts and 'Help' screens should offer integrated guidance, covering some
aspects of financial practice, as well as matters of spreadsheet technique.

  ISBN:1 86166 158 4</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Errors in spreadsheet applications and models are alarmingly common (some
authorities, with justification cite spreadsheets containing errors as the norm
rather than the exception). Faced with this body of evidence, the auditor can
be faced with a huge task - the temptation may be to launch code inspections
for every spreadsheet in an organisation. This can be very expensive and
time-consuming. This paper describes risk assessment based on the &quot;SpACE&quot; audit
methodology used by H M Customs &amp; Excise's tax inspectors. This allows the
auditor to target resources on the spreadsheets posing the highest risk of
error, and justify the deployment of those resources to managers and clients.
Since the opposite of audit risk is audit assurance the paper also offers an
overview of some elements of good practice in the use of spreadsheets in
business.

control, and although methods for optimal estimation (including filtering and
prediction) and for optimal control in linear systems were provided by Kalman
in 1960 (with nonlinear extensions since then), there has been, to my
knowledge, no NN algorithm that learns either Kalman prediction or Kalman
control (apart from the special case of stationary control). Here we show how
optimal Kalman prediction and control (KPC), as well as system identification,
can be learned and executed by a recurrent neural network composed of
linear-response nodes, using as input only a stream of noisy measurement data.
  The requirements of KPC appear to impose significant constraints on the
allowed NN circuitry and signal flows. The NN architecture implied by these
constraints bears certain resemblances to the local-circuit architecture of
mammalian cerebral cortex. We discuss these resemblances, as well as caveats
that limit our current ability to draw inferences for biological function. It
has been suggested that the local cortical circuit (LCC) architecture may
perform core functions (as yet unknown) that underlie sensory, motor,and other
cortical processing. It is reasonable to conjecture that such functions may
include prediction, the estimation or inference of missing or noisy sensory
data, and the goal-driven generation of control signals. The resemblances found
between the KPC NN architecture and that of the LCC are consistent with this
conjecture.

a coverage constraint (minimum quality of service) is studied. Assuming the
channel state information is available only at the receiver side and single
antenna nodes, the highest expected rate achievable by a random user in the
network, called expected typical rate, is derived in two scenarios: hard
coverage constraint and soft coverage constraint. In the first case, the
coverage is expressed in terms of the outage probability, while in the second
case, the expected rate should satisfy certain minimum requirement. It is shown
that the optimum solution in both cases (achieving the highest expected typical
rate for given coverage requirements) is achieved by an infinite layer
superposition code for which the optimum power allocation among the different
layers is derived. For the MISO case, a suboptimal coding scheme is proposed,
which is shown to be asymptotically optimal, when the number of transmit
antennas grows at least logarithmically with the number of users in the
network.

  Boundary Nodes in Selfish Packet-Forwarding Wireless Networks</title><categories>cs.IT cs.GT math.IT</categories><comments>to appear in IEEE Transactions on Communications</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In wireless packet-forwarding networks with selfish nodes, application of a
repeated game can induce the nodes to forward each others' packets, so that the
network performance can be improved. However, the nodes on the boundary of such
networks cannot benefit from this strategy, as the other nodes do not depend on
them. This problem is sometimes known as {\em the curse of the boundary nodes}.
To overcome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in
which the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone
nodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing
to forward the boundary nodes' packets. Here, the concept of core is used to
study the stability of the coalitions in such games. Then three types of
fairness are investigated, namely, min-max fairness using nucleolus, average
fairness using the Shapley function, and a newly proposed market fairness.
Based on the specific problem addressed in this paper, market fairness is a new
fairness concept involving fairness between multiple backbone nodes and
multiple boundary nodes. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeated
games and coalition games. Simulation results show how boundary nodes and
backbone nodes form coalitions according to different fairness criteria. The
proposed protocol can improve the network connectivity by about 50%, compared
with pure repeated game schemes.

with each of these detected clusters and charged with recognizing elements of
the associated cluster while rejecting all others. The obtained global
classifier is comprised of a set of cooperating neural networks and completed
by a K-nearest neighbor classifier charged with treating elements rejected by
all the neural networks. Experimental results for the handwritten digit
recognition problem and comparison with neural and statistical nonmodular
classifiers are given.

In this
paper, this concept is generalized with the following definition. We say that a
family of functions from $[n]$ to $[k]$ is a $\delta$-balanced $(n,k)$-family
of perfect hash functions if for every $S \subseteq [n]$, $|S|=k$, the number
of functions that are 1-1 on $S$ is between $T/\delta$ and $\delta T$ for some
constant $T&gt;0$. The standard definition of a family of perfect hash functions
requires that there will be at least one function that is 1-1 on $S$, for each
$S$ of size $k$. In the new notion of balanced families, we require the number
of 1-1 functions to be almost the same (taking $\delta$ to be close to 1) for
every such $S$. Our main result is that for any constant $\delta &gt; 1$, a
$\delta$-balanced $(n,k)$-family of perfect hash functions of size $2^{O(k \log
\log k)} \log n$ can be constructed in time $2^{O(k \log \log k)} n \log n$.
Using the technique of color-coding we can apply our explicit constructions to
devise approximation algorithms for various counting problems in graphs. In
particular, we exhibit a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for
approximating both the number of simple paths of length $k$ and the number of
simple cycles of size $k$ for any $k \leq O(\frac{\log n}{\log \log \log n})$
in a graph with $n$ vertices. The approximation is up to any fixed desirable
relative error.

to allow for disconnected equilibrium networks. There are n players, each is a
vertex in a graph, and a strategy is a subset of players to build edges to. For
each edge a player must pay a cost \alpha, and the individual cost for a player
represents a trade-off between edge costs and shortest path lengths to all
other players. We extend the model to a penalized game (PCG), for which we
reduce the penalty counted towards the individual cost for a pair of
disconnected players to a finite value \beta. Our analysis concentrates on
existence, structure, and cost of disconnected Nash and strong equilibria.
Although the PCG is not a potential game, pure Nash equilibria always and pure
strong equilibria very often exist. We provide tight conditions under which
disconnected Nash (strong) equilibria can evolve. Components of these
equilibria must be Nash (strong) equilibria of a smaller NCG. However, in
contrast to the NCG, for almost all parameter values no tree is a stable
component. Finally, we present a detailed characterization of the price of
anarchy that reveals cases in which the price of anarchy is \Theta(n) and thus
several orders of magnitude larger than in the NCG. Perhaps surprisingly, the
strong price of anarchy increases to at most 4. This indicates that global
communication and coordination can be extremely valuable to overcome socially
inferior topologies in distributed selfish network design.

which is based on a corpus reproducing the kinds of texts children are exposed
to. After presenting the literature in the development of the semantic memory,
a preliminary French corpus of 3.2 million words is described. Similarities in
the resulting semantic space are compared to human data on four tests:
association norms, vocabulary test, semantic judgments and memory tasks. A
second corpus is described, which is composed of subcorpora corresponding to
various ages. This stratified corpus is intended as a basis for developmental
studies. Finally, two applications of these models of semantic memory are
presented: the first one aims at tracing the development of semantic
similarities paragraph by paragraph; the second one describes an implementation
of a model of text comprehension derived from the Construction-integration
model (Kintsch, 1988, 1998) and based on such models of semantic memory.

  Theory</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper, we study capacity bounds for discrete memoryless broadcast
channels with confidential messages. Two private messages as well as a common
message are transmitted; the common message is to be decoded by both receivers,
while each private message is only for its intended receiver. In addition, each
private message is to be kept secret from the unintended receiver where secrecy
is measured by equivocation. We propose both inner and outer bounds to the rate
equivocation region for broadcast channels with confidential messages. The
proposed inner bound generalizes Csisz\'{a}r and K\&quot;{o}rner's rate equivocation
region for broadcast channels with a single confidential message, Liu {\em et
al}'s achievable rate region for broadcast channels with perfect secrecy,
Marton's and Gel'fand and Pinsker's achievable rate region for general
broadcast channels. Our proposed outer bounds, together with the inner bound,
helps establish the rate equivocation region of several classes of discrete
memoryless broadcast channels with confidential messages, including less noisy,
deterministic, and semi-deterministic channels. Furthermore, specializing to
the general broadcast channel by removing the confidentiality constraint, our
proposed outer bounds reduce to new capacity outer bounds for the discrete
memory broadcast channel.

  Channels</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><comments>45 pages, 7 figures, to be submitted to IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The focus of this paper is on spatial precoding in correlated multi-antenna
channels, where the number of independent data-streams is adapted to trade-off
the data-rate with the transmitter complexity. Towards the goal of a
low-complexity implementation, a structured precoder is proposed, where the
precoder matrix evolves fairly slowly at a rate comparable with the statistical
evolution of the channel. Here, the eigenvectors of the precoder matrix
correspond to the dominant eigenvectors of the transmit covariance matrix,
whereas the power allocation across the modes is fixed, known at both the ends,
and is of low-complexity. A particular case of the proposed scheme (semiunitary
precoding), where the spatial modes are excited with equal power, is shown to
be near-optimal in matched channels. A matched channel is one where the
dominant eigenvalues of the transmit covariance matrix are well-conditioned and
their number equals the number of independent data-streams, and the receive
covariance matrix is also well-conditioned. In mismatched channels, where the
above conditions are not met, it is shown that the loss in performance with
semiunitary precoding when compared with a perfect channel information
benchmark is substantial. This loss needs to be mitigated via limited feedback
techniques that provide partial channel information to the transmitter. More
importantly, we develop matching metrics that capture the degree of matching of
a channel to the precoder structure continuously, and allow ordering two matrix
channels in terms of their mutual information or error probability performance.

studied. It is proved that over any erasure channel (with or without memory),
Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes achieve the minimum probability of error
(assuming maximum likelihood decoding). Assuming a memoryless erasure channel,
the error exponent of MDS codes are compared with that of random codes and
linear random codes. It is shown that the envelopes of all these exponents are
identical for rates above the critical rate. Noting the optimality of MDS
codes, it is concluded that both random codes and linear random codes are
exponentially optimal, whether the block sizes is larger or smaller than the
alphabet size.

data matrix from a sampling of its entries. Suppose that we observe m entries
selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and
recover the entries that we have not seen?
  We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what
appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of
sampled entries obeys m &gt;= C n^{1.2} r log n for some positive numerical
constant C, then with very high probability, most n by n matrices of rank r can
be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This
program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The
condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one
replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of
the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well. Our
results are connected with the recent literature on compressed sensing, and
show that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed
from very limited information.

system over slow fading channels, where the inner code is the Golden Code. The
scheme is based on a set partitioning of the Golden Code using two-sided ideals
whose norm is a power of two. In this case, a lower bound for the minimum
determinant is given by the minimum Hamming distance. The description of the
ring structure of the quotients suggests further optimization in order to
improve the overall distribution of determinants. Performance simulations show
that the GC-RS schemes achieve a significant gain over the uncoded Golden Code.

models from loosely annotated images for automatic image annotation and
indexing. The given annotation in training images is loose due to: (1)
ambiguous correspondences between visual features and annotated keywords; (2)
incomplete lists of annotated keywords. The second reason motivates us to
enrich the incomplete annotation in a simple way before learning topic models.
In particular, some imagined keywords are poured into the incomplete annotation
through measuring similarity between keywords. Then, both given and imagined
annotations are used to learning probabilistic topic models for automatically
annotating new images. We conduct experiments on a typical Corel dataset of
images and loose annotations, and compare the proposed method with
state-of-the-art discrete annotation methods (using a set of discrete blobs to
represent an image). The proposed method improves word-driven probability
Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA-words) up to a comparable performance with the
best discrete annotation method, while a merit of PLSA-words is still kept,
i.e., a wider semantic range.

design of rock engineering flowcharts. Firstly, an overall flowchart, based on
information granulation theory has been highlighted. Information granulation
theory, in crisp (non-fuzzy) or fuzzy format, can take into account engineering
experiences (especially in fuzzy shape-incomplete information or superfluous),
or engineering judgments, in each step of designing procedure, while the
suitable instruments modeling are employed. In this manner and to extension of
soft modeling instruments, using three combinations of Self Organizing Map
(SOM), Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS), and Rough Set Theory (RST) crisp
and fuzzy granules, from monitored data sets are obtained. The main underlined
core of our algorithms are balancing of crisp(rough or non-fuzzy) granules and
sub fuzzy granules, within non fuzzy information (initial granulation) upon the
open-close iterations. Using different criteria on balancing best granules
(information pockets), are obtained. Validations of our proposed methods, on
the data set of in-situ permeability in rock masses in Shivashan dam, Iran have
been highlighted.

is a weighted sum of the channel input powers prior to time k. This channel is
motivated by point-to-point communication between two terminals that are
embedded in the same chip. Transmission heats up the entire chip and hence
increases the thermal noise at the receiver. The capacity of this channel (both
with and without feedback) is studied at low transmit powers and at high
transmit powers.
  At low transmit powers, the slope of the capacity-vs-power curve at zero is
computed and it is shown that the heating-up effect is beneficial. At high
transmit powers, conditions are determined under which the capacity is bounded,
i.e., under which the capacity does not grow to infinity as the allowed average
power tends to infinity.

with access to large amount of social network data. This, coupled with the ever
increasing computation speed, storage capacity and data mining capabilities,
led to the renewal of interest in automatic community detection methods.
Surprisingly, there is no universally accepted definition of the community. One
frequently used definition states that ``communities, that have more and/or
better-connected `internal edges' connecting members of the set than `cut
edges' connecting the set to the rest of the world''[Leskovec et al. 20008].
This definition inspired the modularity-maximization class of community
detection algorithms, which look for regions of the network that have higher
than expected density of edges within them. We introduce an alternative
definition which states that a community is composed of individuals who have
more influence on others within the community than on those outside of it. We
present a mathematical formulation of influence, define an influence-based
modularity metric, and show how to use it to partition the network into
communities. We evaluated our approach on the standard data sets used in
literature, and found that it often outperforms the edge-based modularity
algorithm.

cellular network with joint multicell processing, where unlike previous
results, the ideal backhaul network has finite capacity per-cell. Namely, the
cell sites are linked to the central joint processor via lossless links with
finite capacity. The cellular network is abstracted by symmetric models, which
render analytical treatment plausible. For this idealistic model family,
achievable rates are presented for cell-sites that use compress-and-forward
schemes combined with local decoding, for both Gaussian and fading channels.
The rates are given in closed form for the classical Wyner model and the
soft-handover model. These rates are then demonstrated to be rather close to
the optimal unlimited backhaul joint processing rates, already for modest
backhaul capacities, supporting the potential gain offered by the joint
multicell processing approach. Particular attention is also given to the
low-SNR characterization of these rates through which the effect of the limited
backhaul network is explicitly revealed. In addition, the rate at which the
backhaul capacity should scale in order to maintain the original high-SNR
characterization of an unlimited backhaul capacity system is found.

We
capture the requirements of any white-box primitive using a \emph{White-Box
Property (WBP)} and give some negative/positive results. Loosely speaking, the
WBP is defined for some scheme and a security notion (we call the pair a
\emph{specification}), and implies that w.r.t. the specification, an
obfuscation does not leak any ``useful'' information, even though it may leak
some ``useless'' non-black-box information.
  Our main result is a negative one - for most interesting programs, an
obfuscation (under \emph{any} definition) cannot satisfy the WBP for every
specification in which the program may be present. To do this, we define a
\emph{Universal White-Box Property (UWBP)}, which if satisfied, would imply
that under \emph{whatever} specification we conceive, the WBP is satisfied. We
then show that for every non-approximately-learnable family, there exist
(contrived) specifications for which the WBP (and thus, the UWBP) fails.
  On the positive side, we show that there exists an obfuscator for a
non-approximately-learnable family that achieves the WBP for a certain
specification. Furthermore, there exists an obfuscator for a non-learnable (but
approximately-learnable) family that achieves the UWBP.
  Our results can also be viewed as formalizing the distinction between
``useful'' and ``useless'' non-black-box information.

specification of access control. At the same time, we show a sensible
refinement of the specification for which a secure implementation of access
control is possible. Our models and proofs are formalized in the applied pi
calculus, following some new techniques that may be of independent interest.
Finally, we indicate how our principles can be applied to securely distribute
other state machines.

environment, particularly for collaborative applications. Users operate on
their local, persistent replica of shared documents; they can work disconnected
and suffer no network latency. The Telex approach to detect and correct
conflicts is application independent, based on an action-constraint graph (ACG)
that summarises the concurrency semantics of applications. The ACG is stored
efficiently in a multilog structure that eliminates contention and is optimised
for locality. Telex supports multiple applications and multi-document updates.
The Telex system clearly separates system logic (which includes replication,
views, undo, security, consistency, conflicts, and commitment) from application
logic. An example application is a shared calendar for managing multi-user
meetings; the system detects meeting conflicts and resolves them consistently.

However, the quality of this information has been recently questionned. A

transformations based on declarative patterns. These are (atomic or composite)
constraints on triple graphs declaring the allowed or forbidden relationships
between source and target models. In this way, a transformation is defined by
specifying a set of triple graph constraints that should be satisfied by the
result of the transformation.
  The description of the transformation is then compiled into lower-level
operational mechanisms to perform forward or backward transformations, as well
as to establish mappings between two existent models. In this paper we study
one of such mechanisms based on the generation of operational triple graph
grammar rules. Moreover, we exploit deduction techniques at the specification
level to generate more specialized constraints (preserving the specification
semantics) reflecting pattern dependencies, from which additional rules can be
derived.
  This is an extended version of the paper submitted to ICGT'08, with
additional definitions and proofs.

sites on the Internet. Its strong principle of collaborative work and free
editing sometimes generates disputes due to disagreements between users. In
this article we study how the wikipedian community resolves the conflicts and
which roles do wikipedian choose in this process. We observed the users
behavior both in the article talk pages, and in the Arbitration Committee pages
specifically dedicated to serious disputes. We first set up a users typology
according to their involvement in conflicts and their publishing and management
activity in the encyclopedia. We then used those user types to describe users
behavior in contributing to articles that are tagged by the wikipedian
community as being in conflict with the official guidelines of Wikipedia, or
conversely as being well featured.

channels is studied. First, based on numerous observations, a conjecture is
stated that when the belief propagation decoder converges on a set of
equal-capacity channels, it would also converge on any convex combination of
those channels. Then, it is proved that when the stability condition is
satisfied for a number of channels, it is also satisfied for any channel in
their convex hull. For the purpose of code design, a method is proposed which
can decompose every symmetric channel with capacity C into a set of
identical-capacity basis channels. We expect codes that work on the basis
channels to be suitable for any channel with capacity C. Such codes are found
and in comparison with existing LDPC codes that are designed for specific
channels, our codes obtain considerable coding gains when used across a
multitude of channels.

capacity region of the discrete memoryless multiple access channel with
noiseless feedback (MAC-FB). We consider a binary additive noisy MAC-FB whose
feedback capacity is not known. The binary additive noisy MAC considered in
this paper can be viewed as the discrete counterpart of the Gaussian MAC-FB.
Ozarow established that the capacity region of the two-user Gaussian MAC-FB is
given by the cut-set bound. Our result shows that for the discrete version of
the channel considered by Ozarow, this is not the case. Direct evaluation of
our outer bound is intractable due to an involved auxiliary random variable
whose large cardinality prohibits an exhaustive search. We overcome this
difficulty by using functional analysis to explicitly evaluate our outer bound.
Our outer bound is strictly less than the cut-set bound at all points on the
capacity region where feedback increases capacity. In addition, we explicitly
evaluate the Cover-Leung achievable rate region for the binary additive noisy
MAC-FB in consideration. Furthermore, using the tools developed for the
evaluation of our outer bound, we also explicitly characterize the boundary of
the feedback capacity region of the binary erasure MAC, for which the
Cover-Leung achievable rate region is known to be tight. This last result
confirms that the feedback strategies developed by Kramer for the binary
erasure MAC are capacity achieving.

Lev, are systems which in addition to the standard axioms and structural rules
have only logical rules in which exactly one occurrence of a connective is
introduced and no other connective is mentioned. A constructive coherence
criterion for the non-triviality of such systems was defined and it was shown
that a system of this kind admits cut-elimination iff it is coherent. The
semantics of such systems is provided using two-valued non-deterministic
matrices (2Nmatrices). In 2005 Zamansky and Avron extended these results to
systems with unary quantifiers of a very restricted form. In this paper we
substantially extend the characterization of canonical systems to (n,k)-ary
quantifiers, which bind k distinct variables and connect n formulas, and show
that the coherence criterion remains constructive for such systems. Then we
focus on the case of k&amp;#8712;{0,1} and for a canonical calculus G show that it
is coherent precisely when it has a strongly characteristic 2Nmatrix, which in
turn is equivalent to admitting strong cut-elimination.

that are geographically distributed and interconnected by wireless networks.
Sensors gather information about the state of physical world. Actuators react
to this information by performing appropriate actions. WSANs thus enable cyber
systems to monitor and manipulate the behavior of the physical world. WSANs are
growing at a tremendous pace, just like the exploding evolution of Internet.
Supporting quality of service (QoS) will be of critical importance for
pervasive WSANs that serve as the network infrastructure of diverse
applications. To spark new research and development interests in this field,
this paper examines and discusses the requirements, critical challenges, and
open research issues on QoS management in WSANs. A brief overview of recent
progress is given.

quality-of-control (QoC) of networked control systems (NCSs) may degrade
significantly in the presence of limited bandwidth and variable workload. The
goal of this work is to maximize the overall QoC of NCSs through dynamically
allocating available network bandwidth. Based on codesign of control and
scheduling, an integrated feedback scheduler is developed to enable flexible
QoC management in dynamic environments. It encompasses a cascaded feedback
scheduling module for sampling period adjustment and a direct feedback
scheduling module for priority modification. The inherent characteristics of
priority-driven control networks make it feasible to implement the proposed
feedback scheduler in real-world systems. Extensive simulations show that the
proposed approach leads to significant QoC improvement over the traditional
open-loop scheduling scheme under both underloaded and overloaded network
conditions.

consumption is difficult due to the timing constraints. Dynamic voltage scaling
(DVS) has been incorporated into modern microprocessors as a promising
technique for exploring the trade-off between energy consumption and system
performance. However, it remains a challenge to realize the potential of DVS in
unpredictable environments where the system workload cannot be accurately
known. Addressing system-level power-aware design for DVS-enabled embedded
controllers, this paper establishes an analytical model for the DVS system that
encompasses multiple real-time control tasks. From this model, a feedback
control based approach to power management is developed to reduce dynamic power
consumption while achieving good application performance. With this approach,
the unpredictability and variability of task execution times can be attacked.
Thanks to the use of feedback control theory, predictable performance of the
DVS system is achieved, which is favorable to real-time applications. Extensive
simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.

generation of sensor networks. Despite intensive research in wireless sensor
networks (WSNs), limited work has been found in the open literature in the
field of WSANs. In particular, quality-of-service (QoS) management in WSANs
remains an important issue yet to be investigated. As an attempt in this
direction, this paper develops a fuzzy logic control based QoS management
(FLC-QM) scheme for WSANs with constrained resources and in dynamic and
unpredictable environments. Taking advantage of the feedback control
technology, this scheme deals with the impact of unpredictable changes in
traffic load on the QoS of WSANs. It utilizes a fuzzy logic controller inside
each source sensor node to adapt sampling period to the deadline miss ratio
associated with data transmission from the sensor to the actuator. The deadline
miss ratio is maintained at a pre-determined desired level so that the required
QoS can be achieved. The FLC-QM has the advantages of generality, scalability,
and simplicity. Simulation results show that the FLC-QM can provide WSANs with
QoS support.

time, there has been ample evidence demonstrating that spreadsheet errors are
common and nontrivial. Quite simply, spreadsheet error rates are comparable to
error rates in other human cognitive activities and are caused by fundamental
limitations in human cognition, not mere sloppiness. Nor does ordinary &quot;being
careful&quot; eliminate errors or reduce them to acceptable levels.

errors are both common and non-trivial. Now we must seek ways to reduce
spreadsheet errors. Several approaches have been suggested, some of which are
promising and others, while appealing because they are easy to do, are not
likely to be effective. To date, only one technique, cell-by-cell code
inspection, has been demonstrated to be effective. We need to conduct further
research to determine the degree to which other techniques can reduce
spreadsheet errors.

Spreadsheets are developed by people who are very skilled in their main job
function, be it finance, procurement, or production planning, but often have
had no formal training in spreadsheet use. IT auditors focus on mainstream
information systems but regard spreadsheets as user problems, outside their
concerns. Internal auditors review processes, but not the tools that support
decision making in these processes.
  This paper highlights the gaps between risk management and end user awareness
in spreadsheet research. In addition the potential benefits of software agent
technologies to the management of risk in spreadsheets are explored. This paper
discusses the current research into end user computing and spreadsheet use
awareness.

schemata borrowed from the theory of abductive diagnosis, using temporal logic
to model the time-oriented aspects expressed in a guideline. Previously, we
have shown that these requirements can be verified using interactive theorem
proving techniques. In this paper, we investigate how this approach can be
mapped to the facilities of a resolution-based theorem prover, Otter, and a
complementary program that searches for finite models of first-order
statements, Mace. It is shown that the reasoning required for checking the
quality of a guideline can be mapped to such fully automated theorem-proving
facilities. The medical quality of an actual guideline concerning diabetes
mellitus 2 is investigated in this way.

crossings. The \emph{untangling problem} is to eliminate all edge crossings by
moving as few vertices as possible to new positions. Let $fix(G)$ denote the
maximum number of vertices that can be left fixed in the worst case. In the
\emph{allocation problem}, we are given a planar graph $G$ on $n$ vertices
together with an $n$-point set $X$ in the plane and have to draw $G$ without
edge crossings so that as many vertices as possible are located in $X$. Let
$fit(G)$ denote the maximum number of points fitting this purpose in the worst
case. As $fix(G)\le fit(G)$, we are interested in upper bounds for the latter
and lower bounds for the former parameter.
  For each $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct an infinite sequence of graphs with
$fit(G)=O(n^{\sigma+\epsilon})$, where $\sigma&lt;0.99$ is a known graph-theoretic
constant, namely the shortness exponent for the class of cubic polyhedral
graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of graphs with
$fit(G)=o(n)$. On the other hand, we prove that $fix(G)\ge\sqrt{n/30}$ for all
$G$ with tree-width at most 2. This extends the lower bound obtained by Goaoc
et al. [Discrete and Computational Geometry 42:542-569 (2009)] for outerplanar
graphs.
  Our upper bound for $fit(G)$ is based on the fact that the constructed graphs
can have only few collinear vertices in any crossing-free drawing. To prove the
lower bound for $fix(G)$, we show that graphs of tree-width 2 admit drawings
that have large sets of collinear vertices with some additional special
properties.

${\sum_v a_{iv} x_v \le 1}$ for each $i$ and ${x_v \ge 0}$ for each $v$. Here
$c_{kv} \in \{0,1\}$, $a_{iv} \in \{0,1\}$, and the support sets ${V_i = \{v :
a_{iv} &gt; 0 \}}$ and ${V_k = \{v : c_{kv}&gt;0 \}}$ have bounded size; in
particular, we study the case $|V_k| \le 2$. Each agent $v$ is responsible for
choosing the value of $x_v$ based on information within its constant-size
neighbourhood; the communication network is the hypergraph where the sets $V_k$
and $V_i$ constitute the hyperedges. We present a local approximation algorithm
which achieves an approximation ratio arbitrarily close to the theoretical
lower bound presented in prior work.

graphical user interface (GUI). However, many scientific applications are used
with a command line interface (CLI) for the ease of development and increased
flexibility this mode provides. Scientific application developers would benefit
from being able to provide a GUI easily for their CLI programs, thus retaining
the advantages of both modes of interaction. GuiLiner is a generic, extensible
and flexible front-end designed to ``host'' a wide variety of data analysis or
simulation programs. Scientific application developers who produce a correctly
formatted XML file describing their program's options and some of its
documentation can immediately use GuiLiner to produce a carefully implemented
GUI for their analysis or simulation programs.

the hyperbolic plane. Our algorithm produces greedy drawings, which support
greedy geometric routing, so that a message M between any pair of vertices may
be routed geometrically, simply by having each vertex that receives M pass it
along to any neighbor that is closer in the hyperbolic metric to the message's
eventual destination. More importantly, for networking applications, our
algorithm produces succinct drawings, in that each of the vertex positions in
one of our embeddings can be represented using O(log n) bits and the
calculation of which neighbor to send a message to may be performed efficiently
using these representations. These properties are useful, for example, for
routing in sensor networks, where storage and bandwidth are limited.

analytic structures (e.g. Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, probability spaces,
etc.). Classical computable model theory is used to examine the algorithmic
structure of mathematical objects that can be described in classical
first-order logic. The present paper shows that probabilistic computation
(sometimes called randomized computation) can play an analogous role for
structures described in continuous first-order logic. The main result of this
paper is an effective completeness theorem, showing that every decidable
continuous first-order theory has a probabilistically decidable model. Later
sections give examples of the application of this framework to various classes
of structures, and to some problems of computational complexity theory.

by coefficients of initial polynomials. Finally, we discuss usage of recursive

&quot;recursive subresultant,&quot; along with investigation of their properties. A
recursive PRS is defined as, if there exists the GCD (greatest common divisor)
of initial polynomials, a sequence of PRSs calculated &quot;recursively&quot; for the GCD
and its derivative until a constant is derived, and recursive subresultants are
defined by determinants representing the coefficients in recursive PRS as
functions of coefficients of initial polynomials. We give three different
constructions of subresultant matrices for recursive subresultants; while the
first one is built-up just with previously defined matrices thus the size of
the matrix increases fast as the recursion deepens, the last one reduces the
size of the matrix drastically by the Gaussian elimination on the second one
which has a &quot;nested&quot; expression, i.e. a Sylvester matrix whose elements are
themselves determinants.

cluster in order to maintain their competitiveness in the world market. The
cluster development relies on two key success factors which are knowledge
sharing and collaboration between the actors in the cluster. Thus, our study
tries to propose knowledge management system to support knowledge management
activities within the cluster. To achieve the objectives of this study,
ontology takes a very important role in knowledge management process in various
ways; such as building reusable and faster knowledge-bases, better way for
representing the knowledge explicitly. However, creating and representing
ontology create difficulties to organization due to the ambiguity and
unstructured of source of knowledge. Therefore, the objectives of this paper
are to propose the methodology to create and represent ontology for the
organization development by using knowledge engineering approach. The
handicraft cluster in Thailand is used as a case study to illustrate our
proposed methodology.

proposed by Brams and Sanver [Electoral Studies, 25(2):287-305, 2006], and here
adjusted so as to coerce admissibility of the votes (rather than excluding
inadmissible votes a priori), with respect to procedural control. In such
control scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election
via actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters.
SP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of
candidates, where in elections with at least two candidates the voters'
approval strategies are adjusted--if needed--to approve of their most-preferred
candidate and to disapprove of their least-preferred candidate. This rule
coerces admissibility of the votes even in the presence of control actions, and
hybridizes, in effect, approval with pluralitiy voting.
  We prove that this system is computationally resistant (i.e., the
corresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of
constructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to
control than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a
polynomial-time winner problem. In particular, SP-AV is (after Copeland voting,
see Faliszewski et al. [AAIM-2008, Springer LNCS 5034, pp. 165-176, 2008]) the
second natural voting system with an easy winner-determination procedure that
is known to have full resistance to constructive control, and unlike Copeland
voting it in addition displays broad resistance to destructive control.

by combining quantum cryptographic techniques and some ideas in classical
cryptography. In the presented scheme, the signatory and the receiver can share
a long-term secret key with the arbitrator by utilizing the key together with a
random number. While in previous quantum signature schemes, the key shared
between the signatory and the arbitrator or between the receiver and the
arbitrator could be used only once, and thus each time when a signatory needs
to sign, the signatory and the receiver have to obtain a new key shared with
the arbitrator through a quantum key distribution protocol. Detailed
theoretical analysis shows that the proposed scheme is efficient and provably
secure.

multiband signals that have high bandwidths. In this paper we propose a new
scheme for reconstructing multiband sparse signals using a small number of
sampling channels. The scheme, which we call synchronous multirate sampling
(SMRS), entails gathering samples synchronously at few different rates whose
sum is significantly lower than the Nyquist sampling rate. The signals are
reconstructed by solving a system of linear equations. We have demonstrated an
accurate and robust reconstruction of signals using a small number of sampling
channels that operate at relatively high rates. Sampling at higher rates
increases the signal to noise ratio in samples. The SMRS scheme enables a
significant reduction in the number of channels required when the sampling rate
increases. We have demonstrated, using only three sampling channels, an
accurate sampling and reconstruction of 4 real signals (8 bands). The matrices
that are used to reconstruct the signals in the SMRS scheme also have low
condition numbers. This indicates that the SMRS scheme is robust to noise in
signals. The success of the SMRS scheme relies on the assumption that the
sampled signals are sparse. As a result most of the sampled spectrum may be
unaliased in at least one of the sampling channels. This is in contrast to
multicoset sampling schemes in which an alias in one channel is equivalent to
an alias in all channels. We have demonstrated that the SMRS scheme obtains
similar performance using 3 sampling channels and a total sampling rate 8 times
the Landau rate to an implementation of a multicoset sampling scheme that uses
6 sampling channels with a total sampling rate of 13 times the Landau rate.

of a sparse signal using noisy projections defined by various classes of
measurement matrices. Our analysis is high-dimensional in nature, in which the
number of observations $n$, the ambient signal dimension $p$, and the signal
sparsity $k$ are all allowed to tend to infinity in a general manner. This
paper makes two novel contributions. First, we provide sharper necessary
conditions for exact support recovery using general (non-Gaussian) dense
measurement matrices. Combined with previously known sufficient conditions,
this result yields sharp characterizations of when the optimal decoder can
recover a signal for various scalings of the sparsity $k$ and sample size $n$,
including the important special case of linear sparsity ($k = \Theta(p)$) using
a linear scaling of observations ($n = \Theta(p)$). Our second contribution is
to prove necessary conditions on the number of observations $n$ required for
asymptotically reliable recovery using a class of $\gamma$-sparsified
measurement matrices, where the measurement sparsity $\gamma(n, p, k) \in
(0,1]$ corresponds to the fraction of non-zero entries per row. Our analysis
allows general scaling of the quadruplet $(n, p, k, \gamma)$, and reveals three
different regimes, corresponding to whether measurement sparsity has no effect,
a minor effect, or a dramatic effect on the information-theoretic limits of the
subset recovery problem.

  Primary Users in Cognitive Radio Networks</title><categories>cs.IT math.IT</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This paper considers spectrum sharing for wireless communication between a
cognitive radio (CR) link and a primary radio (PR) link. It is assumed that the
CR protects the PR transmission by applying the so-called
interference-temperature constraint, whereby the CR is allowed to transmit
regardless of the PR's on/off status provided that the resultant interference
power level at the PR receiver is kept below some predefined threshold. For the
fading PR and CR channels, the interference-power constraint at the PR receiver
is usually one of the following two types: One is to regulate the average
interference power (AIP) over all the fading states, while the other is to
limit the peak interference power (PIP) at each fading state. From the CR's
perspective, given the same average and peak power threshold, the AIP
constraint is more favorable than the PIP counterpart because of its more
flexibility for dynamically allocating transmit powers over the fading states.
On the contrary, from the perspective of protecting the PR, the more
restrictive PIP constraint appears at a first glance to be a better option than
the AIP. Some surprisingly, this paper shows that in terms of various forms of
capacity limits achievable for the PR fading channel, e.g., the ergodic and
outage capacities, the AIP constraint is also superior over the PIP. This
result is based upon an interesting interference diversity phenomenon, i.e.,
randomized interference powers over the fading states in the AIP case are more
advantageous over deterministic ones in the PIP case for minimizing the
resultant PR capacity losses. Therefore, the AIP constraint results in larger
fading channel capacities than the PIP for both the CR and PR transmissions.

significant impact on the algorithm's performance, both the search speed and
the search quality. The search pattern should be designed to fit the motion
vector probability (MVP) distribution characteristics of the real-world
sequences. In this paper, we build a directional model of MVP distribution to
describe the directional-center-biased characteristic of the MVP distribution
and the directional characteristics of the conditional MVP distribution more
exactly based on the detailed statistical data of motion vectors of eighteen
popular sequences. Three directional search patterns are firstly designed by
utilizing the directional characteristics and they are the smallest search
patterns among the popular ones. A new algorithm is proposed using the
horizontal cross search pattern as the initial step and the horizontal/vertical
diamond search pattern as the subsequent step for the fast BMME, which is
called the directional cross diamond search (DCDS) algorithm. The DCDS
algorithm can obtain the motion vector with fewer search points than CDS, DS or
HEXBS while maintaining the similar or even better search quality. The gain on
speedup of DCDS over CDS or DS can be up to 54.9%. The simulation results show
that DCDS is efficient, effective and robust, and it can always give the faster
search speed on different sequences than other fast block-matching algorithm in
common use.

Life (EOL) time, an idea to incline the satellite orbit in order to cover a new
region has emerged in the recent years. As a prolate dual-spin vehicle, Palapa
B2R has to be stabilized against its internal energy dissipation effect. This
work is focused on analyzing the dynamics of the reusable satellite in its
inclined orbit. The study discusses in particular the stability of the prolate
dual-spin satellite under the effect of perturbed field of gravitation due to
the inclination of its elliptical orbit. Palapa B2R physical data was
substituted into the dual-spin's equation of motion. The coefficient of zonal
harmonics J2 was induced into the gravity-gradient moment term that affects the
satellite attitude. The satellite's motion and attitude were then simulated in
the perturbed gravitational field by J2, with the variation of orbit's
eccentricity and inclination. The analysis of the satellite dynamics and its
stability was conducted for designing a control system for the vehicle in its
new inclined orbit.

inputs and disturbances, but also higher bandwidth of its dynamics. These
properties make model helicopters, as a flying robot, more difficult to
control. The dynamics model accuracy will determine the performance of the
designed controller. It is attractive in this regards to have a controller that
can accommodate the unmodeled dynamics or parameter changes and perform well in
such situations. Coefficient Diagram Method (CDM) is chosen as the candidate to
synthesize such a controller due to its simplicity and convenience in
demonstrating integrated performance measures including equivalent time
constant, stability indices and robustness. In this study, CDM is implemented
for a design of multivariable controller for a small scale helicopter during
hover and cruise flight. In the synthesis of MIMO CDM, good design common sense
based on hands-on experience is necessary. The low level controller algorithm
is designed as part of hybrid supervisory control architecture to be
implemented on an onboard computer system. Its feasibility and performance are
evaluated based on its robustness, desired time domain system responses and
compliance to hard-real time requirements.

an interface with multi-modal displays and input controls. Then, the role of
the interface will not be restricted to be a support of the interactions
between the ground operator and vehicles. Interface must take part in the
interaction management too. In this paper, we show that recent works in
pragmatics and philosophy provide a suitable theoretical framework for the next
generation of UV System's interface. We concentrate on two main aspects of the
collaborative model of interaction based on acceptance: multi-strategy approach
for communicative act generation and interpretation and communicative
alignment.

properties of the underlying channel beyond its entropy and the ability to
sample from it. On the negative side, we show that the number of samples the
sender must obtain from the channel is exponential in the rate of the
stegosystem. On the positive side, we present the first secret-key stegosystem
that essentially matches this lower bound regardless of the entropy of the
underlying channel. Furthermore, for high-entropy channels, we present the
first secret-key stegosystem that matches this lower bound statelessly (i.e.,
without requiring synchronized state between sender and receiver).

cancellation and detection schemes. The common property of these detection
methods is the usage of Alamouti and quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes.
For detecting $J$ users each having $N$ transmit antennas, these schemes
require only $J$ antennas at the receiver. Our analysis shows that when having
$M$ receive antennas, the array-processing schemes provide the diversity order
of $N(M-J+1)$. In addition, our results prove that regardless of the number of
users or receive antennas, when using maximum-likelihood decoding we get the
full transmit and receive diversities, i.e. $NM$, similar to the
no-interference scenario.

smartcards. They claimed a number of features of their scheme, e.g. a
dictionary of verification tables is not required to authenticate users; users
can choose their password freely; mutual authentication is provided between the
user and the remote system; the communication cost and the computational cost
are very low; users can update their password after the registration phase; a
session key agreed by the user and the remote system is generated in every
session; and the nonce-based scheme which does not require a timestamp (to
solve the serious time synchronization problem) etc.
  In this paper We show that Liaw et al.'s scheme does not stand with various
security requirements and is completely insecure.

recast the metamorphosis equations of into the Euler-Poincare variational

underlying the process of metamorphosis in image matching to the physical
concept of order parameter in the theory of complex fluids. After developing
the general theory, we reinterpret various examples, including point set, image
and density metamorphosis. We finally discuss the issue of matching measures
with metamorphosis, for which we provide existence theorems for the initial and

about the set of trips that passengers make, usually referred to as an
Origin/Destination (OD) matrix. Obtaining this data is problematic and
expensive in general, especially in the case of buses because on-board
ticketing systems do not record where and when passengers get off a bus. In
this paper we describe a novel and inexpensive system that uses off-the-shelf
Bluetooth hardware to accurately record passenger journeys. Here we show how
our system can be used to derive passenger OD matrices, and additionally we
show how our data can be used to further improve public transport services.

  - I. in Memory of W.P. Dayawansa</title><categories>stat.ME cs.CV math.ST stat.TH</categories><comments>24 pages</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this article, for the first time, one develops a nonparametric methodology
for an analysis of shapes of configurations of landmarks on real 3D objects
from regular camera photographs, thus making 3D shape analysis very accessible.
A fundamental result in computer vision by Faugeras (1992), Hartley, Gupta and
Chang (1992) is that generically, a finite 3D configuration of points can be
retrieved up to a projective transformation, from corresponding configurations
in a pair of camera images. Consequently, the projective shape of a 3D
configuration can be retrieved from two of its planar views. Given the inherent
registration errors, the 3D projective shape can be estimated from a sample of
photos of the scene containing that configuration. Projective shapes are here
regarded as points on projective shape manifolds. Using large sample and
nonparametric bootstrap methodology for extrinsic means on manifolds, one gives
confidence regions and tests for the mean projective shape of a 3D
configuration from its 2D camera images.

to increase spectrum utilization by exploiting unused spectrum in dynamically
changing environments. By extending previous results, we investigate the
capacity gains achievable with this dynamic spectrum approach in asymmetric
fading channels. More specifically, we allow the secondary-to-primary and
secondary-to-secondary user channels to undergo Rayleigh or Rician fading, with
arbitrary link power. In order to compute the capacity, we derive the
distributions of ratios of Rayleigh and Rician variables. Compared to the
symmetric fading scenario, our results indicate several interesting features of
the capacity behaviour under both average and peak received power constraints.
Finally, the impact of multiple primary users on the capacity under asymmetric
fading has also been studied.

Submitted to IEEE Trans. Wireless</comments><acm-class>C.2.1; C.4</acm-class><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Outage probabilities and single-hop throughput are two important performance
metrics that have been evaluated for certain specific types of wireless
networks. However, there is a lack of comprehensive results for larger classes
of networks, and there is no systematic approach that permits the convenient
comparison of the performance of networks with different geometries and levels
of randomness.
  The uncertainty cube is introduced to categorize the uncertainty present in a
network. The three axes of the cube represent the three main potential sources
of uncertainty in interference-limited networks: the node distribution, the
channel gains (fading), and the channel access (set of transmitting nodes). For
the performance analysis, a new parameter, the so-called {\em spatial
contention}, is defined. It measures the slope of the outage probability in an
ALOHA network as a function of the transmit probability $p$ at $p=0$. Outage is
defined as the event that the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is below a
certain threshold in a given time slot. It is shown that the spatial contention
is sufficient to characterize outage and throughput in large classes of
wireless networks, corresponding to different positions on the uncertainty
cube. Existing results are placed in this framework, and new ones are derived.
  Further, interpreting the outage probability as the SIR distribution, the
ergodic capacity of unit-distance links is determined and compared to the
throughput achievable for fixed (yet optimized) transmission rates.

  Fixed-Parameter Tractability</title><categories>cs.CG cs.CC</categories><comments>Journal version</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A \emph{binary tanglegram} is a drawing of a pair of rooted binary trees
whose leaf sets are in one-to-one correspondence; matching leaves are connected
by inter-tree edges. For applications, for example, in phylogenetics, it is
essential that both trees are drawn without edge crossings and that the
inter-tree edges have as few crossings as possible. It is known that finding a
tanglegram with the minimum number of crossings is NP-hard and that the problem
is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to that number.
  We prove that under the Unique Games Conjecture there is no constant-factor
approximation for binary trees. We show that the problem is NP-hard even if
both trees are complete binary trees. For this case we give an $O(n^3)$-time
2-approximation and a new, simple fixed-parameter algorithm. We show that the
maximization version of the dual problem for binary trees can be reduced to a
version of MaxCut for which the algorithm of Goemans and Williamson yields a
0.878-approximation.

one-to-one correspondence; matching leaves are connected by inter-tree edges.
For applications, for example in phylogenetics or software engineering, it is
required that the individual trees are drawn crossing-free. A natural
optimization problem, denoted tanglegram layout problem, is thus to minimize
the number of crossings between inter-tree edges.
  The tanglegram layout problem is NP-hard and is currently considered both in
application domains and theory. In this paper we present an experimental
comparison of a recursive algorithm of Buchin et al., our variant of their
algorithm, the algorithm hierarchy sort of Holten and van Wijk, and an integer
quadratic program that yields optimal solutions.

provides a suitable semantic framework for a fully abstract embedding of
untimed processes into timed ones. Finally, we show that the notion can be
refined to include sensitivity to divergence.

within several disciplines, spanning broad areas of science. We show that the
probability that an article is cited $c$ times has large variations between
different disciplines, but all distributions are rescaled on a universal curve
when the relative indicator $c_f=c/c_0$ is considered, where $c_0$ is the
average number of citations per article for the discipline. In addition we show
that the same universal behavior occurs when citation distributions of articles
published in the same field, but in different years, are compared. These
findings provide a strong validation of $c_f$ as an unbiased indicator for
citation performance across disciplines and years. Based on this indicator, we
introduce a generalization of the h-index suitable for comparing scientists
working in different fields.

online algorithms in the context of a specific problem, namely, the two server
problem on three colinear points. Even though the problem is simple, it
encapsulates a core challenge in online algorithms which is to balance
greediness and adaptability. We examine Competitive Analysis, the Max/Max
Ratio, the Random Order Ratio, Bijective Analysis and Relative Worst Order
Analysis, and determine how these measures compare the Greedy Algorithm, Double
Coverage, and Lazy Double Coverage, commonly studied algorithms in the context
of server problems. We find that by the Max/Max Ratio and Bijective Analysis,
Greedy is the best of the three algorithms. Under the other measures, Double
Coverage and Lazy Double Coverage are better, though Relative Worst Order
Analysis indicates that Greedy is sometimes better. Only Bijective Analysis and
Relative Worst Order Analysis indicate that Lazy Double Coverage is better than
Double Coverage. Our results also provide the first proof of optimality of an
algorithm under Relative Worst Order Analysis.

started in 1994 with the aim to implement a suite of neural tools for data
mining in astronomical massive data sets. At a difference with its ancestor,
which was implemented under Matlab, VO-Neural is written in C++, object
oriented, and it is specifically tailored to work in distributed computing
architectures. We discuss the current status of implementation of VO-Neural,
present an application to the classification of Active Galactic Nuclei, and
outline the ongoing work to improve the functionalities of the package.

citizen in modern database management. As such, we need techniques to correctly
and efficiently process uncertain data in database systems. In particular, data
reduction techniques that can produce concise, accurate synopses of large
probabilistic relations are crucial. Similar to their deterministic relation
counterparts, such compact probabilistic data synopses can form the foundation
for human understanding and interactive data exploration, probabilistic query
planning and optimization, and fast approximate query processing in
probabilistic database systems.
  In this paper, we introduce definitions and algorithms for building
histogram- and wavelet-based synopses on probabilistic data. The core problem
is to choose a set of histogram bucket boundaries or wavelet coefficients to
optimize the accuracy of the approximate representation of a collection of
probabilistic tuples under a given error metric. For a variety of different
error metrics, we devise efficient algorithms that construct optimal or near
optimal B-term histogram and wavelet synopses. This requires careful analysis
of the structure of the probability distributions, and novel extensions of
known dynamic-programming-based techniques for the deterministic domain. Our
experiments show that this approach clearly outperforms simple ideas, such as
building summaries for samples drawn from the data distribution, while taking
equal or less time.

  Service Set</title><categories>cs.NI</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  When the stations in an IEEE 802.11 infrastructure Basic Service Set (BSS)
employ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in the transport layer, this
exacerbates per-flow unfair access which is a direct result of uplink/downlink
bandwidth asymmetry in the BSS. We propose a novel and simple analytical model
to approximately calculate the per-flow TCP congestion window limit that
provides fair and efficient TCP access in a heterogeneous wired-wireless
scenario. The proposed analysis is unique in that it considers the effects of
varying number of uplink and downlink TCP flows, differing Round Trip Times
(RTTs) among TCP connections, and the use of delayed TCP Acknowledgment (ACK)
mechanism. Motivated by the findings of this analysis, we design a link layer
access control block to be employed only at the Access Point (AP) in order to
resolve the unfair access problem. The novel and simple idea of the proposed
link layer access control block is employing a congestion control and filtering
algorithm on TCP ACK packets of uplink flows, thereby prioritizing the access
of TCP data packets of downlink flows at the AP. Via simulations, we show that
short- and long-term fair access can be provisioned with the introduction of
the proposed link layer access control block to the protocol stack of the AP
while improving channel utilization and access delay.

downlink stations in the IEEE 802.11e infrastructure Basic Service Set (BSS)
when the default settings of the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA)
parameters are used. We discuss how the transport layer protocol
characteristics alleviate the unfairness problem. We design a simple,
practical, and standard-compliant framework to be employed at the Access Point
(AP) for fair and efficient access provisioning. A dynamic measurement-based
EDCA parameter adaptation block lies in the core of this framework. The
proposed framework is unique in the sense that it considers the characteristic
differences of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol
(UDP) flows and the coexistence of stations with varying bandwidth or
Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Via simulations, we show that our
solution provides short- and long-term fair access for all stations in the
uplink and downlink employing TCP and UDP flows with non-uniform packet rates
in a wired-wireless heterogeneous network. In the meantime, the QoS
requirements of coexisting real-time flows are also maintained.

(dis-)similarity measure between two genomes, e.g. in order to construct a
phylogeny. All the existing measures are defined on genomes without duplicates.
However, we know that genes can be duplicated within the same genome. One
possible approach to overcome this difficulty is to establish a one-to-one
correspondence (i.e. a matching) between genes of both genomes, where the
correspondence is chosen in order to optimize the studied measure. In this
paper, we are interested in three measures (number of breakpoints, number of
common intervals and number of conserved intervals) and three models of
matching (exemplar, intermediate and maximum matching models). We prove that,
for each model and each measure M, computing a matching between two genomes
that optimizes M is APX-hard. We also study the complexity of the following
problem: is there an exemplarization (resp. an intermediate/maximum matching)
that induces no breakpoint? We prove the problem to be NP-Complete in the
exemplar model for a new class of instances, and we show that the problem is in
P in the maximum matching model. We also focus on a fourth measure: the number
of adjacencies, for which we give several approximation algorithms in the
maximum matching model, in the case where genomes contain the same number of
duplications of each gene.

probabilistic model checking of Markov Chains and Markov Decision Processes.
(Finite) paths in counterexamples are grouped together in witnesses that are
likely to provide similar debugging information to the user. We list five
properties that witnesses should satisfy in order to be useful as debugging
aid: similarity, accuracy, originality, significance, and finiteness. Our
witnesses contain paths that behave similar outside strongly connected
components.
  This papers shows how to compute these witnesses by reducing the problem of
generating counterexamples for general properties over Markov Decision
Processes, in several steps, to the easy problem of generating counterexamples
for reachability properties over acyclic Markov Chains.

variable that occurs positively in one clause and negatively in the other. A
CNF formula without any conflicts is satisfiable. The Lovasz Local Lemma
implies that a k-CNF formula is satisfiable if each clause conflicts with at
most 2^k/e-1 clauses. It does not, however, give any good bound on how many
conflicts an unsatisfiable formula has globally. We show here that every
unsatisfiable k-CNF formula requires 2.69^k conflicts and there exist
unsatisfiable k-CNF formulas with 3.51^k conflicts.

while moving in a random environment. The problem consists in inferring
properties of the environment from recorded snapshots. We consider here the
case of a fluid seeded with identical passive particles that diffuse and are
advected by a flow. Our approach rests on efficient algorithms to estimate the
weighted number of possible matchings among particles in two consecutive
snapshots, the partition function of the underlying graphical model. The
partition function is then maximized over the model parameters, namely
diffusivity and velocity gradient. A Belief Propagation (BP) scheme is the
backbone of our algorithm, providing accurate results for the flow parameters
we want to learn. The BP estimate is additionally improved by incorporating
Loop Series (LS) contributions. For the weighted matching problem, LS is
compactly expressed as a Cauchy integral, accurately estimated by a saddle
point approximation. Numerical experiments show that the quality of our
improved BP algorithm is comparable to the one of a fully polynomial randomized
approximation scheme, based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method,
while the BP-based scheme is substantially faster than the MCMC scheme.

assumed to perform without error, a system where noise perturbs both
computational devices and communication channels is considered here. This paper
studies limits in processing noisy signals with noisy circuits by investigating
the effect of noise on standard iterative decoders for low-density parity-check
codes. Concentration of decoding performance around its average is shown to
hold when noise is introduced into message-passing and local computation.
Density evolution equations for simple faulty iterative decoders are derived.
In one model, computing nonlinear estimation thresholds shows that performance
degrades smoothly as decoder noise increases, but arbitrarily small probability
of error is not achievable. Probability of error may be driven to zero in
another system model; the decoding threshold again decreases smoothly with
decoder noise. As an application of the methods developed, an achievability
result for reliable memory systems constructed from unreliable components is
provided.

with improved security with respect to the classical scheme introduced by
Brassard in 1983. In that protocol, the shared key is the seed of a
pseudo-random generator (PRG) and a hash function is used to create the
authentication tag of a public message. We show that a quantum encoding of
secret bits offers more security than the classical XOR function introduced by
Brassard. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between the bias of a PRG
and the amount of information about the key that the attacker can retrieve from
a block of authenticated messages. Finally, we prove that quantum resources can
improve both the secrecy of the key generated by the PRG and the secrecy of the
tag obtained with a hidden hash function.

public the results of their work and to preserve the collective memory of the
institution. This includes the effective use of information and communication
technologies (ICT) to systematically compile academic and research achievements
as well as disseminate effectively this accumulated knowledge to society at
large. Current efforts in Latin America and Venezuela in particular, are
limited but provide some valuable insights to pave the road to this important
goal. The institutional repository of Universidad de Los Andes (ULA) in
Venezuela (www.saber.ula.ve) is such an example of ICT usage to store, manage
and disseminate digital material produced by our University. In this paper we
elaborate on the overall process of promoting a culture of content creation,
publishing and preservation within ULA.

spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws
governing human motion remains limited thanks to the lack of tools to monitor
the time resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of
100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six month
period. We find that in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the
prevailing Levy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high
degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized
by a time independent characteristic length scale and a significant probability
to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for
differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory,
the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability
distribution, indicating that despite the diversity of their travel history,
humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel
patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic
prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent based modeling.

communication of sensors that is guaranteed to be collision-free. The proposed
schedule is shown to be optimal in the number of time slots.

artificial intelligence technologies in crisis response. This paper discusses
the role of artificial intelligence technologies; namely, robotics, ontology

HOL and PVS. Church's logic has a simple set-theoretic semantics, making it
trustworthy and extensible. We factor HOL into a constructive core plus axioms
of excluded middle and choice. We similarly factor standard set theory, ZFC,
into a constructive core, IZF, and axioms of excluded middle and choice. Then
we provide the standard set-theoretic semantics in such a way that the
constructive core of HOL is mapped into IZF. We use the disjunction, numerical
existence and term existence properties of IZF to provide a program extraction
capability from proofs in the constructive core.
  We can implement the disjunction and numerical existence properties in two
different ways: one using Rathjen's realizability for IZF and the other using a
new direct weak normalization result for IZF by Moczydlowski. The latter can
also be used for the term existence property.

propositions/hypotheses in the light of new evidence lies at the heart of
Bayesian inference. The basic natural assumption, as summarized in van
Fraassen's Reflection Principle ([1984]), would be that in the absence of new
evidence the belief should not change. Yet, there are examples that are claimed
to violate this assumption. The apparent paradox presented by such examples, if
not settled, would demonstrate the inconsistency and/or incompleteness of the
Bayesian approach and without eliminating this inconsistency, the approach
cannot be regarded as scientific.
  The Sleeping Beauty Problem is just such an example. The existing attempts to
solve the problem fall into three categories. The first two share the view that
new evidence is absent, but differ about the conclusion of whether Sleeping
Beauty should change her belief or not, and why. The third category is
characterized by the view that, after all, new evidence (although hidden from
the initial view) is involved.
  My solution is radically different and does not fall in either of these
categories. I deflate the paradox by arguing that the two different degrees of
belief presented in the Sleeping Beauty Problem are in fact beliefs in two
different propositions, i.e. there is no need to explain the (un)change of
belief.

We extend the existing method of experimental realisation of Steiner trees in
$n$-terminal problem through soap films to observe new non-minimal Steiner
trees. We also produced spanning tree configurations for the first time by our
method. Experimentally, by varying the pin diameter, we have achieved these new
stable soap film configurations. A new algorithm is presented for creating
these Steiner trees theoretically.
  Exact lengths of these Steiner tree configurations are calculated using a
geometrical method. An exact two-parameter empirical formula is proposed for
estimating the lengths of these soap film configurations in six-pin soap film
problem.

through iterative averaging has been used for simulation of cooperative
interactions between objects of a system with the purpose of investigation of
the conformational organization of the system. Interactions between objects
were analyzed within the space of an isotropic field of one of the objects
(drifter). Such an isotropic field of an individual object can be viewed as a
prototype of computer ego. It allows visualization of a holistic space of
multi-object relations (HSMOR) which has a complex structure depending on the
number of objects, their mutual arrangement in space, and the type of metric
used for assessment of (dis)similarities between the objects. In the course of
computer simulation of cooperative interactions between the objects, only those
points of the space were registered which corresponded to transitions in
hierarchical grouping. Such points appeared to aggregate into complex spatial
structures determining a unique internal organization of a respective HSMOR. We
describe some of the peculiarities of such structures, referred to by us as
attractor membranes, and discuss their properties. We also demonstrate the
peculiarities of the changing of intergroup similarities which occurs when a
drifter infinitely moves away from the fixed objects.

communication system, which consists of a secondary user (SU) having multiple
transmit antennas and a single receive antenna and a primary user (PU) having a
single receive antenna. The channel state information (CSI) on the link of the
SU is assumed to be perfectly known at the SU transmitter (SU-Tx). However, due
to loose cooperation between the SU and the PU, only partial CSI of the link
between the SU-Tx and the PU is available at the SU-Tx. With the partial CSI
and a prescribed transmit power constraint, our design objective is to
determine the transmit signal covariance matrix that maximizes the rate of the
SU while keeping the interference power to the PU below a threshold for all the
possible channel realization within an uncertainty set. This problem, termed
the robust cognitive beamforming problem, can be naturally formulated as a
semi-infinite programming (SIP) problem with infinitely many constraints. This
problem is first transformed into the second order cone programming (SOCP)
problem and then solved via a standard interior point algorithm. Then, an
analytical solution with much reduced complexity is developed from a geometric
perspective. It is shown that both algorithms obtain the same optimal solution.
Simulation examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms.

signer to delegate the signature authority to a group of 'n' proxy signers with
the condition that 't' or more proxy signers can cooperatively sign messages on
behalf of the original signer and the signatures can only be verified by any
two designated verifiers and that they cannot convince anyone else of this
fact.

and workload variability, which lead to uncertainty in resource availability.
This raises great challenges to software design and programming in multitasking
environments. In this paper, the emerging methodology of feedback scheduling is
introduced to address these challenges. As a closed-loop approach to resource
management, feedback scheduling promises to enhance the flexibility and
resource efficiency of various software programs through dynamically
distributing available resources among concurrent tasks based on feedback
information about the actual usage of the resources. With emphasis on the
behavioral design of feedback schedulers, we describe a general framework of
feedback scheduling in the context of real-time control applications. A simple
yet illustrative feedback scheduling algorithm is given. From a programming
perspective, we describe how to modify the implementation of control tasks to
facilitate the application of feedback scheduling. An event-driven paradigm
that combines time-triggered and event-triggered approaches is proposed for
programming of the feedback scheduler. Simulation results argue that the
proposed event-driven paradigm yields better performance than time-triggered
paradigm in dynamic environments where the workload varies irregularly and
unpredictably.

resource constraints and workload uncertainties. To achieve much better system
performance in unpredictable environments than traditional design approaches, a
novel methodology, control-scheduling codesign, is emerging in the context of
integrating feedback control and real-time computing. The aim of this work is
to provide a better understanding of this emerging methodology and to spark new
interests and developments in both the control and computer science
communities. The state of the art of control-scheduling codesign is captured.
Relevant research efforts in the literature are discussed under two categories,
i.e., control of computing systems and codesign for control systems. Critical
open research issues on integrating control and computing are also outlined.

than in the remaining plane. One can choose to enter and exit H at any point.
The highway time distance between a pair of points is the minimum time required
to move from one point to the other, with optional use of H.
  The highway hull HH(S,H) of a point set S is the minimal set containing S as
well as the shortest paths between all pairs of points in HH(S,H), using the
highway time distance.
  We provide a Theta(n log n) worst-case time algorithm to find the highway
hull under the L_1 metric, as well as an O(n log^2 n) time algorithm for the
L_2 metric which improves the best known result of O(n^2).
  We also define and construct the useful region of the plane: the region that
a highway must intersect in order that the shortest path between at least one
pair of points uses the highway.

Specifically, trading-off biological accuracy for computational efficiency, we
explore using wavelet and grouplet-like transforms to parallel the tuning of
visual cortex V1 and V2 cells, alternated with max operations to achieve scale
and translation invariance. A feature selection procedure is applied during
learning to accelerate recognition. We introduce a simple attention-like
feedback mechanism, significantly improving recognition and robustness in
multiple-object scenes. In experiments, the proposed algorithm achieves or
exceeds state-of-the-art success rate on object recognition, texture and

genome duplication - random loss model of genome rearrangement initiated in a
paper of Chaudhuri, Chen, Mihaescu, and Rao in SODA 2006 and continued by
Bouvel and Rossin in 2007. In this model, genomes composed of n genes are
modeled by permutations of the set of integers [1..n], that can evolve through
duplication-loss steps. It was previously shown that the class of permutations
obtained in this model after a given number p of steps is a class of
pattern-avoiding permutations of finite basis. The excluded patterns were
described as the minimal permutations with d=2^p descents, minimal being
intended in the sense of the pattern-involvement relation on permutations.
Here, we give a local and simpler characterization of the set B_d of minimal
permutations with d descents. We also provide a more detailed analysis -
characterization, bijection and enumeration - of two particular subsets of B_d,
namely the patterns in B_d of size d+2 and 2d.

is ignorant of the amount of interference it inflicts on the primary license
holder. A model for such a situation is proposed and analyzed. The primary
sends packets across an erasure channel and employs simple ACK/NAK feedback
(ARQs) to retransmit erased packets. Furthermore, its erasure probabilities are
influenced by the cognitive radio's activity. While the cognitive radio does
not know these interference characteristics, it can eavesdrop on the primary's
ARQs. The model leads to strategies in which the cognitive radio adaptively
adjusts its input based on the primary's ARQs thereby guaranteeing the primary
exceeds a target packet rate. A relatively simple strategy whereby the
cognitive radio transmits only when the primary's empirical packet rate exceeds
a threshold is shown to have interesting universal properties in the sense that
for unknown time-varying interference characteristics, the primary is
guaranteed to meet its target rate. Furthermore, a more intricate version of
this strategy is shown to be capacity-achieving for the cognitive radio when
the interference characteristics are time-invariant.

  September 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This paper considers the noncooperative maximization of mutual information in
the Gaussian interference channel in a fully distributed fashion via game
theory. This problem has been studied in a number of papers during the past
decade for the case of frequency-selective channels. A variety of conditions
guaranteeing the uniqueness of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) and convergence of
many different distributed algorithms have been derived. In this paper we
provide a unified view of the state-of-the-art results, showing that most of
the techniques proposed in the literature to study the game, even though
apparently different, can be unified using our recent interpretation of the
waterfilling operator as a projection onto a proper polyhedral set. Based on
this interpretation, we then provide a mathematical framework, useful to derive
a unified set of sufficient conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of the NE
and the global convergence of waterfilling based asynchronous distributed
algorithms.
  The proposed mathematical framework is also instrumental to study the
extension of the game to the more general MIMO case, for which only few results
are available in the current literature. The resulting algorithm is, similarly
to the frequency-selective case, an iterative asynchronous MIMO waterfilling
algorithm. The proof of convergence hinges again on the interpretation of the
MIMO waterfilling as a matrix projection, which is the natural generalization
of our results obtained for the waterfilling mapping in the frequency-selective
case.

where the network traffic load may vary unpredictably over time. The sampling
in sensors is conventionally time triggered with fixed periods. In this
context, only worse-than-possible quality of control (QoC) can be achieved when
the network is underloaded, while overloaded conditions may significantly
degrade the QoC, even causing system instability. This is particularly true
when the bandwidth of the wireless network is limited and shared by multiple
control loops. To address these problems, a flexible time-triggered sampling
scheme is presented in this work. Smart sensors are used to facilitate dynamic
adjustment of sampling periods, which enhances the flexibility and resource
efficiency of the system based on time-triggered sampling. Feedback control
technology is exploited for adapting sampling periods in a periodic manner. The
deadline miss ratio in each control loop is maintained at/around a desired
level, regardless of workload variations. Simulation results show that the
proposed sampling scheme is able to deal with dynamic and unpredictable
variations in network traffic load. Compared to conventional time-triggered
sampling, it leads to much better QoC in WCSs operating in dynamic
environments.

sensor networks. Serving as the backbone of control applications, WSANs will
enable an unprecedented degree of distributed and mobile control. However, the
unreliability of wireless communications and the real-time requirements of
control applications raise great challenges for WSAN design. With emphasis on
the reliability issue, this paper presents an application-level design
methodology for WSANs in mobile control applications. The solution is generic
in that it is independent of the underlying platforms, environment, control
system models, and controller design. To capture the link quality
characteristics in terms of packet loss rate, experiments are conducted on a
real WSAN system. From the experimental observations, a simple yet efficient
method is proposed to deal with unpredictable packet loss on actuator nodes.
Trace-based simulations give promising results, which demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

single antenna at the source and the destination and two antennas at each of
the R relays is considered. A new class of distributed space time block codes
called Co-ordinate Interleaved Distributed Space-Time Codes (CIDSTC) are
introduced where, in the first phase, the source transmits a T-length complex
vector to all the relays and in the second phase, at each relay, the in-phase
and quadrature component vectors of the received complex vectors at the two
antennas are interleaved and processed before forwarding them to the
destination. Compared to the scheme proposed by Jing-Hassibi, for $T \geq 4R$,
while providing the same asymptotic diversity order of 2R, CIDSTC scheme is
shown to provide asymptotic coding gain with the cost of negligible increase in
the processing complexity at the relays. However, for moderate and large values
of P, CIDSTC scheme is shown to provide more diversity than that of the scheme
proposed by Jing-Hassibi. CIDSTCs are shown to be fully diverse provided the
information symbols take value from an appropriate multi-dimensional signal
set.

Jarkko Kari, in 1994. In the present paper, we show that the answer is also
positive for the hyperbolic plane: the problem is undecidable.

  University of Johannesburg, South Africa, 7 -9 July 2008</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In our modern society telephony has developed to an omnipresent service.
People are available at anytime and anywhere. Furthermore the Internet has
emerged to an important communication medium. These facts and the raising
availability of broadband internet access has led to the fusion of these two
services. Voice over IP or short VoIP is the keyword, that describes this
combination. The advantages of VoIP in comparison to classic telephony are
location independence, simplification of transport networks, ability to
establish multimedia communications and the low costs. Nevertheless one can
easily see, that combining two technologies, always brings up new challenges
and problems that have to be solved. It is undeniable that one of the most
annoying facet of the Internet nowadays is email spam. According to different
sources email spam is considered to be 80 to 90 percent of the email traffic
produced. The threat of so called voice spam or Spam over Internet Telephony
(SPIT) is even more fatal, for the annoyance and disturbance factor is much
higher. As instance an email that hits the inbox at 4 p.m. is useless but will
not disturb the user much. In contrast a ringing phone at 4 p.m. will lead to a
much higher disturbance. From the providers point of view both email spam and
voice spam produce unwanted traffic and loss of trust of customers into the
service. In order to mitigate this threat different approaches from different
parties have been developed. This paper focuses on state of the art anti voice
spam solutions, analyses them and reveals their weak points. In the end a SPIT
producing benchmark tool will be introduced, that attacks the presented anti
voice spam solutions. With this tool it is possible for an administrator of a
VoIP network to test how vulnerable his system is.

generalization of conflict repartition rules, and a combination of these two
rules. In the belief functions theory one of the major problem is the conflict
repartition enlightened by the famous Zadeh's example. To date, many
combination rules have been proposed in order to solve a solution to this
problem. Moreover, it can be important to consider the specificity of the
responses of the experts. Since few year some unification rules are proposed.
We have shown in our previous works the interest of the proportional conflict
redistribution rule. We propose here a mixed combination rule following the
proportional conflict redistribution rule modified by a discounting procedure.
This rule generalizes many combination rules.

and so it has been intensively studied during recent years. Previous work has
shown the relevance of some features, such as the synchronicity of the
updating, the clustering of the network or the influence of the update rule.
This has been done, however, for concrete settings with particular games,
networks and update rules, with the consequence that some contradictions have
arisen and a general understanding of these topics is missing in the broader
context of the space of 2x2 games. To address this issue, we have performed a
systematic and exhaustive simulation in the different degrees of freedom of the
problem. In some cases, we generalize previous knowledge to the broader context
of our study and explain the apparent contradictions. In other cases, however,
our conclusions refute what seems to be established opinions in the field, as
for example the robustness of the effect of spatial structure against changes
in the update rule, or offer new insights into the subject, e.g. the relation
between the intensity of selection and the asymmetry between the effects on
games with mixed equilibria.

Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) channels assuming binary inputs and binary
signature codes in the presence of additive noise with an arbitrary
distribution. The envelope of this family gives a relatively tight lower bound
in terms of the number of users, spreading gain and the noise distribution. The
derivation methods for the noiseless and the noisy channels are different but
when the noise variance goes to zero, the noisy channel bound approaches the
noiseless case. The behavior of the lower bound shows that for small noise
power, the number of users can be much more than the spreading gain without any
significant loss of information (overloaded CDMA). A conjectured upper bound is
also derived under the usual assumption that the users send out equally likely
binary bits in the presence of additive noise with an arbitrary distribution.
As the noise level increases, and/or, the ratio of the number of users and the
spreading gain increases, the conjectured upper bound approaches the lower
bound. We have also derived asymptotic limits of our bounds that can be
compared to a formula that Tanaka obtained using techniques from statistical
physics; his bound is close to that of our conjectured upper bound for large
scale systems.

nodes will stop providing service for others once they have received a certain
amount of service. Examples include BitTorent's unchoking policy, BAR Gossip's
balanced exchanges, and threshold strategies in scrip systems. An attacker can
exploit this by providing service in a targeted way to prevent chosen nodes
from providing service. While such attacks cannot be prevented, we discuss
techniques that can be used to limit the damage they do. These techniques
presume that a certain number of processes will follow the recommended
protocol, even if they could do better by ``gaming'' the system.

within which the surface is a terrain, projects to an immersed surface in the
plane, the boundary of which is a self-intersecting curve. Under what
circumstances can we reverse these mappings algorithmically? Shor and van Wyk
considered one such problem, determining whether a curve is the boundary of an
immersed disk; they showed that the self-overlapping curves defined in this way
can be recognized in polynomial time. We show that several related problems are
more difficult: it is NP-complete to determine whether an immersed disk is the
projection of a surface embedded in space, or whether a curve is the boundary
of an immersed surface in the plane that is not constrained to be a disk.
However, when a casing is supplied with a self-intersecting curve, describing
which component of the curve lies above and which below at each crossing, we
may determine in time linear in the number of crossings whether the cased curve
forms the projected boundary of a surface in space. As a related result, we
show that an immersed surface with a single boundary curve that crosses itself
n times has at most 2^{n/2} combinatorially distinct spatial embeddings, and we
discuss the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for related
problems.

networks, we define and study the Bounded Budget Connection (BBC) game - we
have a collection of n players or nodes each of whom has a budget for
purchasing links; each link has a cost as well as a length and each node has a
set of preference weights for each of the remaining nodes; the objective of
each node is to use its budget to buy a set of outgoing links so as to minimize
its sum of preference-weighted distances to the remaining nodes.
  We study the structural and complexity-theoretic properties of pure Nash
equilibria in BBC games. We show that determining the existence of a pure Nash
equilibrium in general BBC games is NP-hard. However, in a natural variant,
fractional BBC games - where it is permitted to buy fractions of links - a pure
Nash equilibrium always exists. A major focus is the study of (n,k)-uniform BBC
games - those in which all link costs, link lengths and preference weights are
equal (to 1) and all budgets are equal (to k). We show that a pure Nash
equilibrium or stable graph exists for all (n,k)-uniform BBC games and that all
stable graphs are essentially fair (i.e. all nodes have similar costs). We
provide an explicit construction of a family of stable graphs that spans the
spectrum from minimum total social cost to maximum total social cost. We also
study a special family of regular graphs in which all nodes imitate the &quot;same&quot;
buying pattern, and show that if n is sufficiently large no such regular graph
can be a pure Nash equilibrium. We analyze best-response walks on the
configuration defined by the uniform game. Lastly, we extend our results to the
case where each node seeks to minimize its maximum distance to the other nodes.

such as Coq, may greatly improve usability of the tool. Unfortunately adding an
arbitrary set of rewrite rules may render the underlying formal system
undecidable and inconsistent. While ways to ensure termination and confluence,
and hence decidability of type-checking, have already been studied to some
extent, logical consistency has got little attention so far. In this paper we
show that consistency is a consequence of canonicity, which in turn follows
from the assumption that all functions defined by rewrite rules are complete.
We provide a sound and terminating, but necessarily incomplete algorithm to
verify this property. The algorithm accepts all definitions that follow
dependent pattern matching schemes presented by Coquand and studied by McBride
in his PhD thesis. It also accepts many definitions by rewriting, containing
rules which depart from standard pattern matching.

abstraction for sensor networks is challenging due to communication errors and
platform constraints. This paper investigates properties and implementation
reliability for a \emph{local read-write} abstraction. Local read-write is
inspired by the class of read-modify-write operations defined for shared-memory
multiprocessor architectures. The class of read-modify-write operations is
important in solving consensus and related synchronization problems for
concurrency control. Local read-write is shown to be an atomic abstraction for
synchronizing neighborhood states in sensor networks. The paper compares local
read-write to similar lightweight operations in wireless sensor networks, such
as read-all, write-all, and a transaction-based abstraction: for some
optimistic scenarios, local read-write is a more efficient neighborhood
operation. A partial implementation is described, which shows that three
outcomes characterize operation response: success, failure, and cancel. A
failure response indicates possible inconsistency for the operation result,
which is the result of a timeout event at the operation's initiator. The paper
presents experimental results on operation performance with different timeout
values and situations of no contention, with some tests also on various
neighborhood sizes.

or reused to solve problems where machine vision is needed. Generally, the
efficiency of these algorithms is compared against the results given by one or
many human experts. However, in many situations, the location of the real
boundaries of the objects as well as their classes are not known with certainty
by the human experts. Furthermore, only one aspect of the segmentation and
classification problem is generally evaluated. In this paper we present a new
evaluation method for classification and segmentation of image, where we take
into account both the classification and segmentation results as well as the
level of certainty given by the experts. As a concrete example of our method,
we evaluate an automatic seabed characterization algorithm based on sonar
images.

conflict redistribution rule. The Dezert-Smarandache extension of the
Demster-Shafer theory has relaunched the studies on the combination rules
especially for the management of the conflict. Many combination rules have been
proposed in the last few years. We study here different combination rules and
compare them in terms of decision on didactic example and on generated data.
Indeed, in real applications, we need a reliable decision and it is the final
results that matter. This chapter shows that a fine proportional conflict
redistribution rule must be preferred for the combination in the belief
function theory.

An International Journal 20 (2006) 122-141</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In image classification, merging the opinion of several human experts is very
important for different tasks such as the evaluation or the training. Indeed,
the ground truth is rarely known before the scene imaging. We propose here
different models in order to fuse the informations given by two or more
experts. The considered unit for the classification, a small tile of the image,
can contain one or more kind of the considered classes given by the experts. A
second problem that we have to take into account, is the amount of certainty of
the expert has for each pixel of the tile. In order to solve these problems we
define five models in the context of the Dempster-Shafer Theory and in the
context of the Dezert-Smarandache Theory and we study the possible decisions
with these models.

coming from information combination, especially in evidence theory. We can
summarise the solutions for manage the conflict into three different
approaches: first, we can try to suppress or reduce the conflict before the
combination step, secondly, we can manage the conflict in order to give no
influence of the conflict in the combination step, and then take into account
the conflict in the decision step, thirdly, we can take into account the
conflict in the combination step. The first approach is certainly the better,
but not always feasible. It is difficult to say which approach is the best
between the second and the third. However, the most important is the produced
results in applications. We propose here a new combination rule that
distributes the conflict proportionally on the element given this conflict. We
compare these different combination rules on real data in Sonar imagery and
Radar target classification.
